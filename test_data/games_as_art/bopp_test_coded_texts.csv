"The Shapeshifting Detective is a supernatural murder mystery game with three potential culprits, one of whom is the tarot reader Rayne. Possessed by an interdimensional being known as a traveller, Rayne is trying to cover up the murder the traveller forced him to commit. If the player doesn't have Rayne jailed, the game concludes with Rayne kidnapping you, planning to murder you so you cannot have him put in prison for the traveller's crime. In response, you can shapeshift into his closest friend, Bronwyn, to his shock. Resigned, he tells you he has no choice but to leave, in essence exiling himself so the traveller cannot return and he is not imprisoned. With a sad smile, he says ""I'll miss you the most"" and walks away, never to be seen again. I found this scene to be incredibly touching; Rayne is driven by his self-preservation and terror, yet is simultaneously unable to hurt Bronwyn even if refusing to do so puts him at risk. He cuts himself off from who he cares about most to protect them, and I think there's a beauty in that tragedy.","The Shapeshifting Detective is a supernatural murder mystery game with three potential culprits, one of whom is the tarot reader Rayne.

You have spent the entire game nurturing this relationship with Delilah, as well as trying to handle Henry's own trauma. So much of their conversations reflected how I felt, handled things. I wanted there to be a happy ending, a way in which both characters step away contented. But in truth, the ending is almost hallow, a real gut punch.

"It was more like interactive fiction with puzzles and a few mini games. It was pixelated, top down. The story was incredible and powerful. I think it was made more powerful from the level of interaction I had with the story (which you wouldn't get with a film or a painting, which feels like very passive consumption). I felt like I personally was uncovering the twists and turns along with the characters.  It brought up themes of love, loss, regret in complicated nuanced ways, and I personally felt incredibly moved and I cried at points. The music was so well written and I feel like it wouldn't have had the same effect if the soundtrack didn't quite fit. I would rank this as one of the strongest emotional reactions I've ever had to a piece of media.","It was more like **interactive fiction with puzzles and a few mini games**<sup>interaction; artistic experience</sup>.

"While almost every video game uses images and sound to convey information, video games as an art-form delves deeper than just simple communication. Art begin where the users own interpretation of the work affects how they perceive it. For my example game, the main character is left alone on a stormy island. As they explore the island, the narrator reads diary entries that give cryptic clues as to what happened on the island. Decorations amidst the island also fill in further details. The player is left to interpret what it all means, and based on the users life experiences might find that the story means one thing or another. This game touches on melancholy topics such as loneliness, depression, loss, and suicide, and in doing so teleports the user into the bleak lives of the narrator and his characters. The game gives no direct answers to what truly happened in the narrative, and upon finishing the game I was left with a strong sense of desolation. While it may sound like My example is artistic because it was cryptic or emotional, this is only the means by which the art of the game affected me. There was an ever-present sense of purpose and intent behind this game, and through its competencies I came to my own conclusions.","While almost every video game uses images and sound to convey information, **video games as an art-form delves deeper than just simple communication.**<sup>comparison to conventional art forms; artistic experience</sup> **Art begin where the users own interpretation of the work affects how they perceive it.**<sup>thought-provoking</sup> For my example game, **the main character is left alone on a stormy island.

"I reflected on the world created in the game and the use of the narrative and visuals to explore that world. The game is clearly able to be analyzed through the lens of post colonialism, allowing me to consider how the portrayals of fictionalized native populations relates to the real world. I considered why they chose a colonialism focused game and what their intent was--what they wanted to say or how the wanted it to be interpreted. There is a clear attempt to create something marketable, but I do feel that analysis of the game allows for us to examine the human condition or at least or expectations as a society consuming such narratives in the 21st century.","I reflected on the world created in the game and **the use of the narrative and visuals to explore that world**<sup>narrative; visuals</sup>. **The game is clearly able to be analyzed through the lens of post colonialism, allowing me to consider how the portrayals of fictionalized native populations relates to the real world.**<sup>thought-provoking; narrative</sup> **I considered why they chose a colonialism focused game and what their intent was--what they wanted to say or how the wanted it to be interpreted.**<sup>thought-provoking</sup> **There is a clear attempt to create something marketable, but I do feel that analysis of the game allows for us to examine the human condition or at least our expectations as a society consuming such narratives in the 21st century.**<sup>thought-provoking; complexity of human relationships</sup>"

"The game tries not to reach a big target audience as other games are trying. As playing this game, it felt like the creator could fully establish his vision into the product. There no upgrade like level ups, or any additional equipment in this game, neither there are a lot of characters implemented into the game.
Nevertheless the game didn't get boring at all. Also the game forged an abnormal atmosphere which felt like forsaken sadness, due to the emptyness of the environment.
If I finally got to meet a character, it felt pleasurable for a moment, to not being alone anymore. Because of that, I really didn't want to fight the characters, but I had to do it instantly. This felt like kind of wrong, and this emotion gets increased by the sad music playing at the moment the opposing character dies.

"One of the most immersive and intense game experiences I've had was while playing Subnautica. From the very start of the game (crash landing alone on an alien water planet), I truly felt emotions through my character. The game's illustrations, sounds, music, and narrative elements all evoked these emotions. At first I felt the loneliness, hopelessness, and panic: terrified of the horrors that I might encounter in the deep ocean if I ventured too far from my escape pod. I saw the edge of the shallow reef, at first too scared to dive deeper. I heard the chilling cries of large sea creatures echoing in the distance. But the game is about pushing your limits. Eventually I gained the equipment and confidence needed to progress to the next deeper, more dangerous area, but there was never a ""comfortable"" moment. Aside from the audio/visual elements, there is also a mystery about the planet that unfolds as you progress. The story is told through non-traditional narrative elements: your character receives clues and information about the mystery of the planet through scraps of recordings and artifacts, not through direct narration or dialogue. All these elements together kept me on the edge of my seat, adrenaline rushing, like I was truly there.","One of the most **immersive and intense game experiences I've had was while playing Subnautica**<sup>immersion; artistic experience</sup>.

"I think the purpose of art is to make you feel something. This is often achieved with themes, symbols, motifs, culture, and characters. I think games regularly accomplish this well. Shadow of The Colossus is a fantastic game I consider to be art. It uses a similar structure to the hero's journey but it has very little exposition or cutscenes, instead telling you the story by interacting with its world. Interaction is a technique videogames have unique access to over other mediums like film and games that use interaction well to tell their stories are often the most immersive and emotionally impactful. In Shadow of the Colossus, you navigate a vast foliage dense landscape on the hunt to defeat majestic titans roaming the land, the goal of which seems to be saving the life of a girl who has died. The more you defeat, the more you realize you are becoming the monster, the more you question if it's worth it. Your character becomes more dirty and disheveled as the journey progresses and by the end, you are a shell of your former self. You have defeated all the creatures to save the girl but in the process, you became a monster far worse than they ever were. The game ends with this happening literally.

The game is left heavily open to interpretation because of the lack of exposition and games that tell their stories almost solely through interaction are my favorite kind of art.","I think the purpose of art is to **make you feel something**<sup>emotional response</sup>.

There's also water in the game, you can swim and go down the lakes if it's deep enough, the water is animated just like it was real, with the waves and correct lighting, sometimes you can even use it as a mirror if you're standing in the right place.

"The choice near the end of Part 1 of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (on the Black Eagle route) where you decide whether to side with Edelgard or Rhea. The experiences with the game's characters up to that point (in overall plot scenes, single-character support dialogues, and even small in-battle dialogue), overarching plot, and even visual/music cues made it feel like a very significant decisive moment. (In hindsight, it's a bit surprising that a statement like ""This decision will drastically alter the story."" wasn't immersion-breaking, but with the overall quiet except for a 'heartbeat' sound, it made it work. And I only just realized while writing this that at that point, the main character doesn't have a heartbeat.)

"The game made me feel a range of emotions throughout. The base one being a feeling of accomplishment as I completed puzzles and figured out solutions to all the different “experiments”. I also felt joy and happiness, both in completing puzzles that I struggled with and during the moments of dark comedy and deadpan humor.

"The game explores what it is to be a player and/or a creator. It constantly underscores its own status as a human-made digital artefact, yet still manages to convey a compelling, existential narrative disguised as a true story. (Well, actually, it's a true story whichever way you spin it—it just turns out that it's about internal self-conflict rather than an argument between friends.)  It subverts what we think of as hallmarks of games by rejecting sub-goals/incentives/rewards/character or stat progression/enemies/the domination of space, etc., and instead chooses to tell its story at a level of reality/abstraction shared by the player and the narrator–developer. It features beautiful visual motifs/symbolism as well as poetic, sometimes cryptic dialogue. Its 'level' design (more accurately described as scenography or mise-en-scene, I think) is equally thoughtful and evocative. Since there is little (inter)action, much of the game's aesthetics come from how we traverse and inhabit that space (e.g. temporarily being able to only walk backwards; suddenly being able to see what's 'behind the scenes', etc.). In short, rather than being 'meta' just for the sake of edginess/trendiness, the game makes the 'meta' level its primary plane of communication, and does so in a convincing, sophisticated way. (Cf., e.g., Pony Island, which is a bit ham-fisted.)","The game **explores what it is to be a player and/or a creator.**<sup>creativity; artistic experience</sup> **It constantly underscores its own status as a human-made digital artefact, yet still manages to convey a compelling, existential narrative disguised as a true story.**<sup>narrative; thought-provoking</sup> (Well, actually, it's a true story whichever way you spin it—it just turns out that it's about internal self-conflict rather than an argument between friends.) **It subverts what we think of as hallmarks of games by rejecting sub-goals/incentives/rewards/character or stat progression/enemies/the domination of space, etc., and instead chooses to tell its story at a level of reality/abstraction shared by the player and the narrator–developer.**<sup>thought-provoking; narrative</sup> **It features beautiful visual motifs/symbolism as well as poetic, sometimes cryptic dialogue.**<sup>visuals; narrative</sup> **Its 'level' design (more accurately described as scenography or mise-en-scene, I think) is equally thoughtful and evocative.**<sup>craftsmanship; complexity</sup> **Since there is little (inter)action, much of the game's aesthetics come from how we traverse and inhabit that space (e.g. temporarily being able to only walk backwards; suddenly being able to see what's 'behind the scenes', etc.).**<sup>immersion; interaction</sup> **In short, rather than being 'meta' just for the sake of edginess/trendiness, the game makes the 'meta' level its primary plane of communication, and does so in a convincing, sophisticated way.**<sup>thought-provoking; artistic experience</sup> (Cf., e.g., Pony Island, which is a bit ham-fisted.)"

"There are so many moments in narrative, story-driven games in particular that I think classify as art.

"Mechanically, Rimworld is a base-building, colony management sim game. Experientially, the game invites you to be the co-author of a story.

During the loading screen which was an artwork there was a short bit of narrated information like you would find in a museum about Chinese history. 
Then I was thrown onto an artistic map of china with many details and sights. The map instantly sparked my curiosity about so many sights I never new of as I wasn't very familiar with.

"There's many instances I could site, but my favorite so far has been the whole story of The Secret World. For times sake, I'll narrow it down to a specific quest. (though I love so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested in a modern day story based of legends myths and conspiracies being real). In this quest, an incredibly smart 8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last survivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through Carl Jung's theory of the shared subconscious. To do this, you fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You start by picking out of three words, which best describes you. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the opposite. It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like ""Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?"" ""Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?"" All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think you've won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up. Personally, I believe its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure. Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung's philosophy, I hope to be someday soon. But this was about fifteen minutes of a game with a hundred hours, at least, of content. In my mind, art is anything where a medium is used to convey emotions and provoke thought. Through the whole path, I was locked in a reflective state on what made me ""me"", and what doesn't. When I saw the parent buff and read ""they will be there for you in your time of need"", I remembered how much I loved my parents, how much they tried for me and still do despite it all. When I walked through the door to say I was a loner, I really did pause and think on how, despite past anguish, Id chosen that reality myself. I can't change that, but there are upsides to the choice. With part of my definition of art being a medium that conveys emotion and provokes thought, this hits the nail. Thanks for letting me talk about this game, its moved me beyond belief. And Ive only talked about ten or so minutes of it. This was technically a side quest.","There's many instances I could site, but my favorite so far has been the whole story of **The Secret World**<sup>narrative</sup>. For times sake, I'll narrow it down to a specific quest. (though I love so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested in a modern day story based of legends myths and conspiracies being real). In this quest, **an incredibly smart 8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last survivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through Carl Jung's theory of the shared subconscious**<sup>characters; narrative; thought-provoking</sup>. To do this, you **fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream**<sup>immersion; setting</sup>. You start by picking out of three words, which best describes you. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the opposite. It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like ""Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?"" ""Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?"" **All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff.**<sup>interaction; complexity; emotional response</sup> A fight ensues, but once you think you've won, **your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up.**<sup>narrative; transformation</sup> Personally, I believe **its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure**<sup>thought-provoking; emotional response</sup>. Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung's philosophy, I hope to be someday soon.

"The first Bioshock was clearly art for me, I'd get into new areas and just wander around looking at things for as long as it took to see everything. Same thing with Skyrim, I have probably 40 hours of just wandering around following foxes to see where they'd go and admiring the view. A few side scrolling games were clearly designed by artists as well, a great example is Valiant Hearts which uses a sort of card based art to suggest three dimensions without actually modeling them.","The first Bioshock was clearly art for me, **I'd get into new areas and just wander around looking at things for as long as it took to see everything.**<sup>immersion; artistic experience</sup> Same thing with Skyrim, **I have probably 40 hours of just wandering around following foxes to see where they'd go and admiring the view.**<sup>immersion; beauty; artistic experience</sup> **A few side scrolling games were clearly designed by artists as well, a great example is Valiant Hearts which uses a sort of card based art to suggest three dimensions without actually modeling them.**<sup>artistic experience; craftsmanship; comparison to conventional art forms</sup>"
"The game was ""This War of Mine"" - the whole game was, to me, an artistic experience. There are too many instances to recall one in particular, but I do know that the instances that made me think ""wow this is art"" were the most emotional events of the game - the plot twists in the Stories mode, the difficult decisions one has to make, the moments where the gameplay took me off-guard.","The game was ""This War of Mine"" - **the whole game was, to me, an artistic experience.**<sup>artistic experience</sup> There are too many instances to recall one in particular, but **I do know that the instances that made me think ""wow this is art"" were the most emotional events of the game**<sup>emotional response; artistic experience</sup> - **the plot twists in the Stories mode, the difficult decisions one has to make, the moments where the gameplay took me off-guard.**<sup>narrative; emotional response; thought-provoking; engagement</sup>"
"Nearing the end of a dialogue-based RPG, an option to make a perception check appeared apropos of nothing. Upon succeeding, My character encountered and approached the elusive ""insulindian phasmid,"" a cryptid which the game had previously led you to believe was a mere fairy tale. I was able to hold up my hand to it, and using a skill which roughly translates into imagination, i was able to speak with the phasmid. From all the dialogue with the phasmid, I felt nothing but awe towards the creature and the universe at large-- it spoke of large heady concepts like human consciousness in the voice of a small-minded animal, which gave it much more of a feeling of natural wisdom being dispensed than artificial philosophical wankery. A quote that stands out especially to me is ""The anthropods [sic] are in silent and meaningless awe of you. Know that we are watching-- when you're tired, when the vision spins out of control. The insects will be looking on. Rooting for you.""","Nearing the end of a dialogue-based RPG, **an option to make a perception check appeared apropos of nothing.**<sup>interaction</sup> Upon succeeding, **My character encountered and approached the elusive ""insulindian phasmid,"" a cryptid which the game had previously led you to believe was a mere fairy tale.**<sup>characters; narrative</sup> **I was able to hold up my hand to it, and using a skill which roughly translates into imagination, i was able to speak with the phasmid.**<sup>interaction; creativity</sup> **From all the dialogue with the phasmid, I felt nothing but awe towards the creature and the universe at large-- it spoke of large heady concepts like human consciousness in the voice of a small-minded animal, which gave it much more of a feeling of natural wisdom being dispensed than artificial philosophical wankery.**<sup>awe; thought-provoking; emotional response</sup> **A quote that stands out especially to me is ""The anthropods [sic] are in silent and meaningless awe of you.

"Playing AC Origins felt like art for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was visually captivating. Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes.

"For me, art is any medium that conveys an idea or message, or makes the participant experience specific emotions. This game was very philosophical in nature, examining the relationship between good and evil. The game introduces a variety of characters that exemplify either the light side of the force (good) or the dark side (evil) as well as a mentor character whose alignment is somewhere in the middle. 

At one point the mentor character explains that by helping people and taking on their burdens, you are teaching them to rely on other people's generosity for their survival. And one you have left they may actually be worse off. In contrast she also chastises you for overtly evil acts like winton violence.

This part of the game really made me consider the best way we can use our resources to help elevate those in need. Simply giving someone food or shelter is a temporary measure. The true good would come about by empowering those in need and helping them gain the skills and opportunities to care for themselves.","For me, art is any medium that conveys an idea or message, or makes the participant experience specific emotions. **This game was very philosophical in nature, examining the relationship between good and evil.**<sup>thought-provoking</sup> **The game introduces a variety of characters that exemplify either the light side of the force (good) or the dark side (evil) as well as a mentor character whose alignment is somewhere in the middle.**<sup>characters; narrative</sup>
