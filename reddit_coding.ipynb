        "In reflexive coding, your own personal understanding of the data is important in shaping the insights you gain from analysing it. Therefore, before jumping straight into coding the entire dataset with LLMCode, it is wise to investigate just how well the system can replicate your own coding style. In this section, we will initially run the LLM coding with texts from `coded_file` that have also been human-annotated, so that we have a baseline to compare the LLM output to. While this may feel redundant, it helps us calibrate our trust in the system before we code the entire dataset."
