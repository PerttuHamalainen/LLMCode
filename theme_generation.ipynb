This raises concerns about researcher agency—how much control do researchers retain over the interpretation of their data? Similarly, the transparency of LLMs' decision-making processes is limited, making it difficult to trace how specific themes were generated, which may obscure valuable insights or introduce unintended biases. Balancing automation with researcher input is crucial to maintain rigor and interpretive depth in the analysis."

The inner level visualises the themes and the outer level their associated codes, while the sizes of the segments correspond to the number of mentions for each theme and code. You may hover your mouse over the code segments to reveal a randomly chosen example quotation for each."
