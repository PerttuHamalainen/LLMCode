Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"at the end of the true (fifth) ending, the ending credits\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esong flows between english, french, and japanese, and slowly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efades out as a loud hum of people takes the melody, and it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas perhaps the last of many times the game struck me as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eart, as it so perfectly closes a game that so perfectly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimposes and explores questions of human nature in a game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith no humans\",\"It was breathtaking to see what a digital playground can\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elook like.\",\"The game had a simple linear story structure that allowed\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to experience and understand elements of the story at\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour own pace as you play through the game.

The game's controls are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003every simple (there is one small choice at the end but\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eotherwise the player can only move the player character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003earound and occasionally interact with pieces of the set),\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed)\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eperson they miss; the player character walks this audience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethrough daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003einteracted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eno longer sure of while the hologram degrades.

It's a high artistic\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame, where you explore with the character a world.

Basically, for each state of emotion, the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eworld was modified around you, transforming elements already\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esaw.

The Normandy and it's crew are in grave peril\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith everyone scrambling to make repairs, bark out orders,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eor get to the escape pods. You are then moved to your\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, Commander Shepard, a calm and steady leader whose\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eface you cannot see behind his military grade space suit.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhile you make your way to the bridge to retrieve the pilot\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the Normandy you see flames and pylons scarrtered\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethroughout the ship leading up to the cock pit. As you enter\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe CIC (Combat Information Center, the place you used to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enavigate your ship through the galaxy) you are met with an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimmediate contrast to the blaringly loud, creaking, flaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eship into the silent vacuum of space. The entire ceiling has\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebeen ripped off, the artificial gravity isn't working in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis section and you walk at almost a snails pace across to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe cockpit. The only sounds you can hear are your own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebreathing through your helmet and the ship gets almost\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecompletely dark until you emerge at the other end finding\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe pilot. You convince him that the Normandy is gone and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethere's nothing he can do and safely get him to the last\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eescape pod but you're not so lucky.

Below were the various\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eenemies I was supposed to be fighting - and all around me, I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecould see the rest of the levels map - the city in which I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas infiltrating as part of the mission, but also the lush\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eforests and ecosystems surrounding the area. More than\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eanything my attention was captured by the beautiful\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epicturesque sunset happening off in the distance, behind my\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter.\",\"I was about 13, around 1999 or 2000 and games were mostly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edigital toys to spend your time with.

It had a consistent art\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003estyle across all sections, but varied in color palette and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emood. This game is like walking through someone's diary\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecombined with looking at a photo album. You can appreaciate\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eall aspects of this game from its visuals, to its story, to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eits soundtrack.\",\"This game was an absolutely beautiful dreamscape. Gorgeous\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecolors. Every moment a potential still that could be its own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epiece of art. The emotional impact of the game was tangible\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein the years I experienced at the end. The story within was\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egleaned through context clues and careful inspection. The\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecamerawork, the careful curation of progression. It all\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecomes together into an unforgettable experience.\",\"I feel like games, as a mixture of things we already\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econsider art (music, literature, cinematography, etc), need\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto evoke something within the gameplay itself. Undertale\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes this: the game plays out in a way that recommends you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot kill anybody, and doing so gives you a genuinely\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eheartwarming story. It was also marketed specifically as a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame where you don't need to kill anyone. But because you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan play it multiple times, you could also do the inverse:\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ekill EVERYONE. It invokes a dissonance in the player that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eonly a game could create: you've come to love all these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracters, and now you want to see what happens when you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epersonally kill them all. And you have to really try to do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eit: the game forces you to grind out kills, and throws two\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eincredibly difficult bosses at you (one which explicitly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echeats). There are moments where the game points out that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou, THE PLAYER, are making these choices. The most poignant\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof these is once you've finished: you're PERMANENTLY\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epunished for doing the deed; if you do another Pacifist\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eroute, the heartwarming scene at the end instead concludes\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith a stinger and a brief but telltale appearance of the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emonster you created in the genocide route.\",\"While not a singular occurrence, the closest I have ever\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecome to experiencing game as art was during the end of the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efirst Bioshock game, where there is a plot twist that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etriggered for me an entire rethinking of the gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eindustry. It was the first time I felt that a game narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecould make a case for digital game as art. It was very well\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethought-out and carefully driven throughout the game play\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience and I still think it makes a powerful statement\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eon the superior artistic syncretism that games can provide.\",\"Well the video game was centred on the question “what makes\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eus human” and the game had a lot of philosophy, and even\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome of the characters had famous philosophers names.

In some maps of the game,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethere are lots of forests and some worse for wear villages,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand although it's not something you would expect from this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etype of game, sometimes I just stop and marvel how beautiful\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand homely the foresty areas look. I also watch other people\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eplaying the game on Twitch, where sometimes they have tuned\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe visual filters in the game in a way that makes the bleak\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egray image of run down Russia look sunny, warm and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebeautiful, like a painting, especially in those forests with\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe branches moving in the wind.\",\"It’s a story-based iOS game where the narrative is centered\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eon a girl who travels to this mystical island to take care\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof her sick grandfather.

I felt that the game very\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprofoundly captured the experience of living in a small\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprovincial town without prospects, and that the game as a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecombined to capture and express this, and then to transform\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003evisuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped me to physically identify with the main character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"I felt that the game very profoundly captured the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof living in a small provincial town without prospects, and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethat the game as a whole, in its mechanics, its narrative,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eits visuals, combined to capture and express this, and then\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto transform this into an object of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: I experienced the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eNight in the Woods as art, both as a whole, and in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eindividual moments.

The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint.

I felt that the game very profoundly captured the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience of living in a small provincial town without\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eits narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis, and then to transform this into an object of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut these are well tailored to create an experience: the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elight platforming and movement mechanics helped me to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ephysically identify with the main character, and encouraged\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eme to explore the town and know people. And the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein my own home town. I think this physical identification\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped create space for a psychological identification with\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices felt weighty. In conversations with \\\"my\\\" family I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis and living as \\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eemotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eare all about building and maintaining relationships,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edeveloping and maintaining your identity - they do not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaffect your \\\"progress\\\"  or achievements as such - this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptures something fundamental about daily life I think -\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost of our choices are like this. Again the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean object of reflection.       When playing the game I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas creating a language for itself, and about how exciting\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eoverreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eelectrifying moments in the game where I could see a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edistinct language for games being created in a similar way.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eIn this case a language of agency and constraint: the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003euses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe light platforming and exploration element is again\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimportant in this - it brings an element of freedom and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epoint and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereally effective tension between freedom and narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econstraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eway that supports and expresses the themes and experience of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe art.  There is a scene at a party which captures this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewell - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etoo much. But you can only progress through the scene by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edrinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand ways to pass time - you have been away from these people\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efor years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etopics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the knowledge that that is what you're going to do.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThough this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe scene written so convincingly that the effect of these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eforced choices lands very strongly. Without the sense of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efreedom in the game this might have been tedious and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elimiting. I can't think of another work of art which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptures the experience of being (banally) constrained by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour own nature so well. The scene plays out with an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003einevitability which is sad and familiar, but aestheticised\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand distanced by gaming conventions. The medium and the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esubject are combined here in a way that could not happen in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eother narrative forms. And most interestingly it leverages\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeatures of gaming which some have argued make it a poor\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium for narrative. It is a small part of the game, and a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esimple idea, but it works with the materiality and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econstraints of gaming as a medium, to articulate an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience quite forcefully.\",\"In conversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehappy, but also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: I experienced the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eNight in the Woods as art, both as a whole, and in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eindividual moments. I felt that the game very profoundly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptured the experience of living in a small provincial town\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewithout prospects, and that the game as a whole, in its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emechanics, its narrative, its visuals, combined to capture\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand express this, and then to transform this into an object\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof reflection. The game is simple in its visuals and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emechanics, but these are well tailored to create an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: the light platforming and movement mechanics\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped me to physically identify with the main character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"The choices in the game are all about building and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emaintaining relationships, developing and maintaining your\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: I experienced the game Night in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe Woods as art, both as a whole, and in individual\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emoments. I felt that the game very profoundly captured the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience of living in a small provincial town without\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eits narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis, and then to transform this into an object of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut these are well tailored to create an experience: the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elight platforming and movement mechanics helped me to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ephysically identify with the main character, and encouraged\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eme to explore the town and know people. And the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein my own home town. I think this physical identification\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped create space for a psychological identification with\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices felt weighty. In conversations with \\\"my\\\" family I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis and living as \\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eemotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eare all about building and maintaining relationships,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edeveloping and maintaining your identity - they do not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaffect your \\\"progress\\\"  or achievements as such - this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptures something fundamental about daily life I think -\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost of our choices are like this. Again the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean object of reflection.       When playing the game I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas creating a language for itself, and about how exciting\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eoverreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eelectrifying moments in the game where I could see a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edistinct language for games being created in a similar way.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eIn this case a language of agency and constraint: the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003euses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe light platforming and exploration element is again\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimportant in this - it brings an element of freedom and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epoint and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereally effective tension between freedom and narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econstraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eway that supports and expresses the themes and experience of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe art.  There is a scene at a party which captures this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewell - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etoo much. But you can only progress through the scene by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edrinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand ways to pass time - you have been away from these people\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efor years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etopics of conversation.

And the experience of this was of aimlessly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egoing for a walk like I would have in my own home town. I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink this physical identification helped create space for a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epsychological identification with a complex and troubled\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, meaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions.

I think this physical identification\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped create space for a psychological identification with\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices felt weighty. In conversations with \\\"my\\\" family I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis and living as \\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eemotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eare all about building and maintaining relationships,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edeveloping and maintaining your identity - they do not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaffect your \\\"progress\\\"  or achievements as such - this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptures something fundamental about daily life I think -\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost of our choices are like this.

When playing the game I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas creating a language for itself, and about how exciting\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eoverreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eelectrifying moments in the game where I could see a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edistinct language for games being created in a similar way.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eIn this case a language of agency and constraint: the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003euses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe light platforming and exploration element is again\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimportant in this - it brings an element of freedom and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epoint and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereally effective tension between freedom and narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econstraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eway that supports and expresses the themes and experience of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe art.  There is a scene at a party which captures this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewell - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etoo much. But you can only progress through the scene by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edrinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand ways to pass time - you have been away from these people\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efor years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etopics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the knowledge that that is what you're going to do.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThough this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe scene written so convincingly that the effect of these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eforced choices lands very strongly.

The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a way that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esupports and expresses the themes and experience of the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eart.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: I experienced the game Night in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe Woods as art, both as a whole, and in individual\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emoments. I felt that the game very profoundly captured the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience of living in a small provincial town without\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eits narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis, and then to transform this into an object of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut these are well tailored to create an experience: the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elight platforming and movement mechanics helped me to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ephysically identify with the main character, and encouraged\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eme to explore the town and know people. And the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein my own home town. I think this physical identification\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped create space for a psychological identification with\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices felt weighty. In conversations with \\\"my\\\" family I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis and living as \\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eemotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eare all about building and maintaining relationships,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edeveloping and maintaining your identity - they do not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaffect your \\\"progress\\\"  or achievements as such - this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptures something fundamental about daily life I think -\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost of our choices are like this.

It is a small part of the game, and a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esimple idea, but it works with the materiality and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econstraints of gaming as a medium, to articulate an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience quite forcefully.\",\"If you do not drink you run out of interactions and ways to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epass time - you have been away from these people for years,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeel alienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: I experienced the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eNight in the Woods as art, both as a whole, and in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eindividual moments. I felt that the game very profoundly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptured the experience of living in a small provincial town\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewithout prospects, and that the game as a whole, in its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emechanics, its narrative, its visuals, combined to capture\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand express this, and then to transform this into an object\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof reflection. The game is simple in its visuals and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emechanics, but these are well tailored to create an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: the light platforming and movement mechanics\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped me to physically identify with the main character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly.

Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"I can't think of another work of art which captures the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience of being (banally) constrained by your own nature\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eso well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience: I experienced the game Night\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein the Woods as art, both as a whole, and in individual\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emoments. I felt that the game very profoundly captured the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience of living in a small provincial town without\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eits narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis, and then to transform this into an object of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut these are well tailored to create an experience: the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elight platforming and movement mechanics helped me to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ephysically identify with the main character, and encouraged\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eme to explore the town and know people. And the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein my own home town. I think this physical identification\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped create space for a psychological identification with\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices felt weighty. In conversations with \\\"my\\\" family I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis and living as \\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eemotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eare all about building and maintaining relationships,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edeveloping and maintaining your identity - they do not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaffect your \\\"progress\\\"  or achievements as such - this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptures something fundamental about daily life I think -\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost of our choices are like this. Again the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean object of reflection.       When playing the game I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas creating a language for itself, and about how exciting\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eoverreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eelectrifying moments in the game where I could see a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edistinct language for games being created in a similar way.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eIn this case a language of agency and constraint: the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003euses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe light platforming and exploration element is again\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimportant in this - it brings an element of freedom and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epoint and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereally effective tension between freedom and narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econstraint.

If you do not drink you run out of interactions\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand ways to pass time - you have been away from these people\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efor years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etopics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the knowledge that that is what you're going to do.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThough this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe scene written so convincingly that the effect of these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eforced choices lands very strongly.

I felt that the game very profoundly captured the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience of living in a small provincial town without\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eits narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis, and then to transform this into an object of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut these are well tailored to create an experience: the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elight platforming and movement mechanics helped me to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ephysically identify with the main character, and encouraged\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eme to explore the town and know people. And the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein my own home town. I think this physical identification\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped create space for a psychological identification with\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices felt weighty. In conversations with \\\"my\\\" family I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis and living as \\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eemotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eare all about building and maintaining relationships,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edeveloping and maintaining your identity - they do not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaffect your \\\"progress\\\"  or achievements as such - this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecaptures something fundamental about daily life I think -\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost of our choices are like this. Again the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eaestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean object of reflection.       When playing the game I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas creating a language for itself, and about how exciting\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eoverreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eelectrifying moments in the game where I could see a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edistinct language for games being created in a similar way.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eIn this case a language of agency and constraint: the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003euses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe light platforming and exploration element is again\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimportant in this - it brings an element of freedom and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eagency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epoint and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ereally effective tension between freedom and narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econstraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eway that supports and expresses the themes and experience of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe art.  There is a scene at a party which captures this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewell - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etoo much. But you can only progress through the scene by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edrinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand ways to pass time - you have been away from these people\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efor years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etopics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the knowledge that that is what you're going to do.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThough this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe scene written so convincingly that the effect of these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eforced choices lands very strongly.

And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis.

In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do.

Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions.

To do this,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003estart by picking out of three words, which best describes\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eopposite.

The only way out is to evade your\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eshadow and wake yourself up.

It made me think about my own values, and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebeliefs, and morals, and how they can be set up to conflict\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith one another.\",\"The game told a complex and beautiful story about humanity,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eself-sacrifice, and love.\",\"The whole game, really, feels like an art piece to me.

Each area has beautiful,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edistinct music. Colour is also used to differentiate the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eareas. The mood is crafted carefully and very successfully.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eIt really is easy to get lost just exploring the world and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elearning about it. The writing is probably even better, to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebe honest. The game never tells you outright what happened\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto the world or what's really going on. Instead it leaves\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elittle clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracters to tell bits and pieces of the story. Once you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003estart figuring out what's going on, you can't stop thinking\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout it or trying to find out more.

The game left me with a sense of wonder and a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elot of questions to think about. For instance, one of the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emain conflicts of the game is about sacrifice. Children are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esacrificed to become void creatures in order to contain the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eRadiance, a deadly infection that would wipe out this whole\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eworld if left to spread.

I felt that the game very\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprofoundly captured the experience of living in a small\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprovincial town without prospects, and that the game as a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecombined to capture and express this, and then to transform\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003evisuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped me to physically identify with the main character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"at the end of the true (fifth) ending, the ending credits\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esong flows between english, french, and japanese, and slowly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efades out as a loud hum of people takes the melody, and it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas perhaps the last of many times the game struck me as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eart, as it so perfectly closes a game that so perfectly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimposes and explores questions of human nature in a game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith no humans\",\"It was breathtaking to see what a digital playground can\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elook like.\",\"The game had a simple linear story structure that allowed\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to experience and understand elements of the story at\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour own pace as you play through the game.

The game's controls are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003every simple (there is one small choice at the end but\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eotherwise the player can only move the player character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003earound and occasionally interact with pieces of the set),\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed)\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eperson they miss; the player character walks this audience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethrough daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003einteracted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eno longer sure of while the hologram degrades.

After losing, Satan will allow\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to re-try, and after multiple attempts, I defeated Satan\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand felt good about having beaten the game, and after seeing\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe other citizens of Hell react to how I had enabled\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eSatan’s self-destructive behaviour, I started to wonder if I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehad done the right and just thing.

Instead it leaves\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elittle clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracters to tell bits and pieces of the story.

I felt that the game very\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprofoundly captured the experience of living in a small\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprovincial town without prospects, and that the game as a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecombined to capture and express this, and then to transform\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003evisuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped me to physically identify with the main character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"at the end of the true (fifth) ending, the ending credits\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esong flows between english, french, and japanese, and slowly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efades out as a loud hum of people takes the melody, and it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas perhaps the last of many times the game struck me as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eart, as it so perfectly closes a game that so perfectly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimposes and explores questions of human nature in a game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith no humans\",\"It was breathtaking to see what a digital playground can\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elook like.\",\"The game had a simple linear story structure that allowed\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to experience and understand elements of the story at\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour own pace as you play through the game.
