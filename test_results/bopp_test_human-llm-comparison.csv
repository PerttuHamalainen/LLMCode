The game I played used the creation of digital graphics to tell a story that had immense emotional power. And I believe in this case the reason to play this game would be primarily for that emotional journey. The gameplay isn't anything to shout about, the puzzles are pretty simple.

"I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",game takes itself 'seriously'; critique of gamer culture; feeling like dialogue with the developer; fits a common definition of art,critique of gamer culture; didactic; challenging aesthetics; dialogue with developer; fitting traditional definition of art; opening doors for discussions about diverse games as art,0.06526625412207675
