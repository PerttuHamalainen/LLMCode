Meant to invoce strong emotions and attachment to these characters  with no regard to profitability, marketability, or mass appeal of the game as a product. ","The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.",The graphics and the story.,"The graphics of the game, the story line, and the character development were done so well that I consider it art.

The experience was true to life as it depicted Geralts reality in shades of gray rather than being simply black and white, good and evil, etc. One of arts tendencies is to reflect back to us who we are and what we do in an angle we might not have considered before.

","It made me experience feelings that I had rarely if ever encountered on other media. Playing as the characters makes you able to emphatise with them and through their actions the artists are able to convey complex messages and emotions. When well executed, I think the player is not merely a spectator, but a ""cable"" that feels the energy passing through","The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.","This game was an experience that filled me with such emotion, presented me with such beauty, and left me with such a lasting impression that all of it in tender has changed my life In a profound way.

I no longer saw the graphics as a way to play the game or as a way to learn something about the game, but as something else entirely. I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way. For me, art is about feeling something and this video game did that using colors and lines instead of just dialogue and story. ","Whenever I remember this game I am flooded with memories and feelings I have attached to it. This game created an experience for me that I will treasure.

Since games accomplish this through a combination of illustration, animation, sound, music, storytelling elements all together, I would consider these types of experiences art.","It was art because it brought about a deeply emotional response in me, one which was impacted by the perspective of the player.

I found the impact to be greater than many books Ive read and films Ive watched, because of the unique aspect of actually controlling the character in his journey.","The way the visuals made me shift my worldview, art is about emotion and evoking thought, and that scene did just that.",,,,,,,,

It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.  The state of bliss and relaxation at the world, but also emotional investment in the characters and even the town itself was unparalleled to me. ","Interacting with creativity (your own, or someone else's, or both), in any way seems to be an artful experience. Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art.

While I have played many games that I would consider works of art (be it because the graphics were exciting, or the game play was so masterful that it left me amazed, or that the story and visuals left me contemplative), this particular game felt especially impactful. Nearly a year later, I still think about what this game was trying to say, and any media that leaves such an impression is surely artistic.",,,,,,,,,,,
"reflection,  trying to say something about videogames,  reflection on life",9,reflecting back to us who we are,1,"I consider this experience artistic because like any film or book or painting, it told a story that was deeply meaningful. The narrative of the game and its writing wrestled with issues of morality, class, racism, sexism, and many other topics in ways that many other video games have been afraid to touch. The experience was true to life as it depicted Geralts reality in shades of gray rather than being simply black and white, good and evil, etc. One of arts tendencies is to reflect back to us who we are and what we do in an angle we might not have considered before. I think this game did just that in my experience. ",,,,,,,,,,,

Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art.

I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way.

Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction.",,,,,,,,,,,
"feeling of being helped by a complete stranger,  feeling a part of something bigger,  emotional challenge",4,feeling of being helped by a complete stranger,1,"The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming. Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped. I had never seen a truly altruistic action performed by another player in a video game - up until this point.",,,,,,,,,,,
"feeling of being helped by a complete stranger,  feeling a part of something bigger,  emotional challenge",4,feeling a part of something bigger,1,"There was something very serene and beautiful about being elevated and getting to see the rest of this particular level of the game. However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world. So to me personally, In that sense, gaming is most like art when it imitates real life - when it makes me feel as though I am simply one small part of something bigger. ",,,,,,,,,,,

It encapsulates the conflict inherent in advancing standards of living by exploiting nature.

"engaging gameplay,  engaging,  engagement",3,engaging gameplay,1,"The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.",,,,,,,,,,,
