The following presents a qualitative coding of answers from a video game research study. The answers explain why a participant experienced a game as art. The codes summarize the given reasons as compactly as possible, preferably with just one or a few words. If an answer lists multiple reasons, the corresponding codes are separated by semicolons.

Text: If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those. The basic-looking but gorgeous visuals full of rustic charm and colour, the indie music playing away in the background just over the ambience of life going on as normal, the story perfectly blending in with these elements and ticking away in your mind as you play. It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.  The state of bliss and relaxation at the world, but also emotional investment in the characters and even the town itself was unparalleled to me. 

Codes: emotional experience; combination of visuals, music, and story;  immersion; emotional investment

###

Text: It was visually beautiful, immersive and made me ignore the horrible mechanics that would have otherwise ruined it.

Codes: visual beauty; immersion

###

Text: It made me feel the same way as art does. It showed me something new and beautiful.

Codes: something new and beautiful

###

Text: Art as a concept is huge, I think there is a little bit of art in everything. Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, I think real art challenges you in some way or holds up a mirror to reflect in. Firewatch both challenged me emotionally, and caused some deep introspection about relationships.

Codes: emotional challenge; reflection

###

Text: "Art" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.

Codes: deep thoughts and emotions; reflection; empathy with the main character

###

Text: It's one of those game that are loaded with emotional implications, make a clever and conscious use of game mechanics, and where every aspect of the game supports every other aspect of the game and the overall play experience. I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.

Codes: emotional implications; clever and conscious use of game mechanics; coherent whole; conveying something beyond the game world; artistic expression

###

Text: Art leaves the user to reflect and interpret on it. While I have played many games that I would consider works of art (be it because the graphics were exciting, or the game play was so masterful that it left me amazed, or that the story and visuals left me contemplative), this particular game felt especially impactful. Nearly a year later, I still think about what this game was trying to say, and any media that leaves such an impression is surely artistic.

Codes: reflecting on the game's message; lasting impression

###

Text: Feeling real emotions and being outside myself

Codes: emotions; being outside oneself

###

Text: A group of people took time and effort in making this area of the game, Kaer Morhen (and honestly most of the game too, the experience was simply more profound here), so beautiful. It was akin to looking at a photographer's work and wanting to physically visit where the picture was taken.

Codes: effort invested in making the game; beauty

###

Text: It is an immersive world and the music was amazing. I honestly feel like the composer should be studied when our current period moves to music history 

Codes: immersive world; amazing music

###

Text: the richness of pictures/drawings.
- there was almost no text
- it was me who made the art come together

Codes: richness of visuals; own involvement

###

Text: Like a film or book, it was clearly intended to elicit an emotional response and tell a story. Unlike some other games, the story was not there to connect the gameplay: rather, the gameplay was there to advance the story.

Codes: emotional response; gameplay in service of story; analogous to other forms of art

###

Text: It managed to spark my curiosity while being visually pleasing.

Codes: sparking curiosity; visual pleasure

###

Text: In order to advance in the game, the player has to exploit the planet's resources and mark its surface. It encapsulates the conflict inherent in advancing standards of living by exploiting nature. The player doesn't even know where the outputs are going, just that their employer, Ficsit Corporation, requires them.

Codes: conflict; emotional challenge

###

Text: Likely because it was presented to me in the context of an example of a video game as art. But I accepted this because it was a very different type of experience delivered in such a simple and effective package. 

Codes: context of playing; different type of experience

###

Text: Mostly what I described above. Elaborating a little, the game play was not as much of a focus, despite it being a game. It felt more like you were participating in an interactive graphic novel/art project. The emphasis was on the emotions it evoked and connections you felt with the characters -- or rather how you can put yourself very easily in their shoes based on your own experiences with love

Codes: felt like participating in an interactive graphic novel; emotions; empathy with characters

###

Text: An expression of a feeling, emotion, story, etc. 

Codes: feeling; emotion; story

###

Text: As stated above, there is literally nothing a video game could do to NOT be art. Art is not a judgement of merit. 

Codes: all games are art

###

Text: Art has been defined as "The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power." 
The game I played used the creation of digital graphics to tell a story that had immense emotional power. And I believe in this case the reason to play this game would be primarily for that emotional journey. The gameplay isn't anything to shout about, the puzzles are pretty simple. Therefore I believe it falls into that definition.

Codes: story with emotional power; emotional journey

###

Text: In my opinion, art is a form of communicating emotion in abstract ways, whether through a painting or a piece of music. This game was an incredibly emotional journey that I felt very connected to despite never being told what to feel. 

Codes:
