"The Shapeshifting Detective is a supernatural murder mystery game with three potential culprits, one of whom is the tarot reader Rayne. Possessed by an interdimensional being known as a traveller, Rayne is trying to cover up the murder the traveller forced him to commit. If the player doesn't have Rayne jailed, the game concludes with Rayne kidnapping you, planning to murder you so you cannot have him put in prison for the traveller's crime. In response, you can shapeshift into his closest friend, Bronwyn, to his shock. Resigned, he tells you he has no choice but to leave, in essence exiling himself so the traveller cannot return and he is not imprisoned. With a sad smile, he says ""I'll miss you the most"" and walks away, never to be seen again. I found this scene to be incredibly touching; Rayne is driven by his self-preservation and terror, yet is simultaneously unable to hurt Bronwyn even if refusing to do so puts him at risk. He cuts himself off from who he cares about most to protect them, and I think there's a beauty in that tragedy.","""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws.

"It was more like interactive fiction with puzzles and a few mini games. It was pixelated, top down. The story was incredible and powerful.

I felt like I personally was uncovering the twists and turns along with the characters.

"While almost every video game uses images and sound to convey information, video games as an art-form delves deeper than just simple communication. Art begin where the users own interpretation of the work affects how they perceive it. For my example game, the main character is left alone on a stormy island. As they explore the island, the narrator reads diary entries that give cryptic clues as to what happened on the island. Decorations amidst the island also fill in further details. The player is left to interpret what it all means, and based on the users life experiences might find that the story means one thing or another. This game touches on melancholy topics such as loneliness, depression, loss, and suicide, and in doing so teleports the user into the bleak lives of the narrator and his characters. The game gives no direct answers to what truly happened in the narrative, and upon finishing the game I was left with a strong sense of desolation.

Nevertheless the game didn't get boring at all. Also the game forged an abnormal atmosphere which felt like forsaken sadness, due to the emptyness of the environment.
If I finally got to meet a character, it felt pleasurable for a moment, to not being alone anymore. Because of that, I really didn't want to fight the characters, but I had to do it instantly.

"One of many moments in this game that I considered as art: the character enters a valley, right after a small outpost.

"One of the most immersive and intense game experiences I've had was while playing Subnautica. From the very start of the game (crash landing alone on an alien water planet), I truly felt emotions through my character. The game's illustrations, sounds, music, and narrative elements all evoked these emotions. At first I felt the loneliness, hopelessness, and panic: terrified of the horrors that I might encounter in the deep ocean if I ventured too far from my escape pod. I saw the edge of the shallow reef, at first too scared to dive deeper. I heard the chilling cries of large sea creatures echoing in the distance. But the game is about pushing your limits. Eventually I gained the equipment and confidence needed to progress to the next deeper, more dangerous area, but there was never a ""comfortable"" moment. Aside from the audio/visual elements, there is also a mystery about the planet that unfolds as you progress. The story is told through non-traditional narrative elements: your character receives clues and information about the mystery of the planet through scraps of recordings and artifacts, not through direct narration or dialogue. All these elements together kept me on the edge of my seat, adrenaline rushing, like I was truly there.","For a game experience to feel like a work of art to me, it would usually be an immersive experience that creates a real emotional response.

It's amazing how far technology has come.","For me instead of the graphics of the game being a means to an end meaning they allowed me to play the game, I experienced the graphics as a means to their own end. I no longer saw the graphics as a way to play the game or as a way to learn something about the game, but as something else entirely. I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way.

Most notably I remember loading into WoW for the first time as an early teen. I felt extremely immersed and in awe of the world.

"I think the purpose of art is to make you feel something. This is often achieved with themes, symbols, motifs, culture, and characters. I think games regularly accomplish this well. Shadow of The Colossus is a fantastic game I consider to be art. It uses a similar structure to the hero's journey but it has very little exposition or cutscenes, instead telling you the story by interacting with its world. Interaction is a technique videogames have unique access to over other mediums like film and games that use interaction well to tell their stories are often the most immersive and emotionally impactful. In Shadow of the Colossus, you navigate a vast foliage dense landscape on the hunt to defeat majestic titans roaming the land, the goal of which seems to be saving the life of a girl who has died. The more you defeat, the more you realize you are becoming the monster, the more you question if it's worth it. Your character becomes more dirty and disheveled as the journey progresses and by the end, you are a shell of your former self. You have defeated all the creatures to save the girl but in the process, you became a monster far worse than they ever were. The game ends with this happening literally.

The game is left heavily open to interpretation because of the lack of exposition and games that tell their stories almost solely through interaction are my favorite kind of art.","Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle.

And I only just realized while writing this that at that point, the main character doesn't have a heartbeat.) The parts immediately leading up to it and reactions afterward also had excellent voice acting that were great at bringing out the right emotional effects for me.

",I consider this experience as art for two reasons. One is that it is extremely innovative and helps to push the boundaries of storytelling in video games and thus matures the entire medium. The other is that it has a deeper and more complex emotional layer that can be interpreted in many ways.,innovation; pushing the boundaries of storytelling; deep and complex emotions,,,,,,innovative storytelling; pushing boundaries; complex emotional layer; interpretive potential,42

"I became heavily invested in the story and atmosphere of Red Dead Redemption 2, to the extent that I engaged in as many quests as possible to experience as much character interaction as possible. I would also spend hours simply wandering the countryside to take in the beautiful scenery. When the story ended, I was heartbroken at the conclusion and it affected me deeply. I cried through the credits, and I felt like I had lost a close friend. Then, the epilogue began and I felt like it was too soon; I felt like I needed more time to mourn the ending of the game. As I played through the epilogue, I continued to feel sad for the loss of the main character, even as I was happy to see the evolution of the other characters.","I didn't care about the gameplay or mechanics; I was motivated entirely by the visual and emotional beauty, and the emotional experience was so powerful that I still feel strongly when I reflect on the experience.

","I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything I’ve seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar.

The mechanics and aesthetics of the game were in harmony in a way that made the story feel even more alive.

"An RPG I am playing features digital art cut scene s, a plot that could be considered a novel, and a beautifully depicted digital world.","I frequently tell people that playing RPGs is similar to reading a book or watching a movie, but you are able to interact and influence the plot.

"Each level is genuinely insanely beautiful and it's obvious someone put the maximum amount of effort into the visuals and genuinely loved doing it. The creatures and objects and their behavior is also all very creative and whoever designed it all had a lot of fun, making it also very fun to play and experience. That's what makes it art... the people who made it loved making it, and made it the way it is for the sake of making something purely fun and cool and beautiful.","I guess simply because the entire game looks like a drawing, and as an artist I really enjoyed that. People seem to want art to always be something deeper, but I just enjoy good drawings.",good drawings,,,,,,visual style; enjoyment of good drawings,49
"The game explores what it is to be a player and/or a creator. It constantly underscores its own status as a human-made digital artefact, yet still manages to convey a compelling, existential narrative disguised as a true story. (Well, actually, it's a true story whichever way you spin it—it just turns out that it's about internal self-conflict rather than an argument between friends.)  It subverts what we think of as hallmarks of games by rejecting sub-goals/incentives/rewards/character or stat progression/enemies/the domination of space, etc., and instead chooses to tell its story at a level of reality/abstraction shared by the player and the narrator–developer. It features beautiful visual motifs/symbolism as well as poetic, sometimes cryptic dialogue. Its 'level' design (more accurately described as scenography or mise-en-scene, I think) is equally thoughtful and evocative. Since there is little (inter)action, much of the game's aesthetics come from how we traverse and inhabit that space (e.g. temporarily being able to only walk backwards; suddenly being able to see what's 'behind the scenes', etc.). In short, rather than being 'meta' just for the sake of edginess/trendiness, the game makes the 'meta' level its primary plane of communication, and does so in a convincing, sophisticated way. (Cf., e.g., Pony Island, which is a bit ham-fisted.)","I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",game takes itself 'seriously'; critique of gamer culture; feeling like dialogue with the developer; fits a common definition of art,,,,,,critique of gamer culture; challenging aesthetics; dialogue with the developer; fits traditional definition of art; opening the door for discussions about games as art,50

I also loved the character and clothing designs in the game, and appreciated the time and thought that obviously went into creating them.","I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic.

Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover.

"There are so many moments in narrative, story-driven games in particular that I think classify as art. The mechanics of the games being stripped back to their base basics necessitate the developers to spend their time and wow the player in other ways; and they mostly do that through soundtrack and visuals. I can think of so many moments from Life is Strange where I sat there, not playing the game, just watching the world around me; the people walking about, the perfectly-matched music blissfully playing away in the background, the story I'd been experiencing at the forefront of my mind as I immersed myself in the town of the game. Even to this day, no game has ever calmed me as much as Life is Strange has.","If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those.

It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.

"Mechanically, Rimworld is a base-building, colony management sim game. Experientially, the game invites you to be the co-author of a story.

"So part of the game is running around trying to revive these trees, and so this cutscene plays out a few times throughout the game.

Then I was thrown onto an artistic map of china with many details and sights. The map instantly sparked my curiosity about so many sights I never new of as I wasn't very familiar with.

"There's many instances I could site, but my favorite so far has been the whole story of The Secret World. For times sake, I'll narrow it down to a specific quest. (though I love so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested in a modern day story based of legends myths and conspiracies being real). In this quest, an incredibly smart 8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last survivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through Carl Jung's theory of the shared subconscious. To do this, you fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You start by picking out of three words, which best describes you. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the opposite. It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like ""Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?"" ""Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?"" All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think you've won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up. Personally, I believe its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure. Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung's philosophy, I hope to be someday soon. But this was about fifteen minutes of a game with a hundred hours, at least, of content. In my mind, art is anything where a medium is used to convey emotions and provoke thought. Through the whole path, I was locked in a reflective state on what made me ""me"", and what doesn't. When I saw the parent buff and read ""they will be there for you in your time of need"", I remembered how much I loved my parents, how much they tried for me and still do despite it all. When I walked through the door to say I was a loner, I really did pause and think on how, despite past anguish, Id chosen that reality myself. I can't change that, but there are upsides to the choice. With part of my definition of art being a medium that conveys emotion and provokes thought, this hits the nail. Thanks for letting me talk about this game, its moved me beyond belief. And Ive only talked about ten or so minutes of it.

"The game I played was art by cause it was designed as a slow and calm experience, giving the opportunity for reflection. The graphics used were simplistic but communicated the ideas effectively.

"For me, art is any medium that conveys an idea or message, or makes the participant experience specific emotions. This game was very philosophical in nature, examining the relationship between good and evil. The game introduces a variety of characters that exemplify either the light side of the force (good) or the dark side (evil) as well as a mentor character whose alignment is somewhere in the middle. 

At one point the mentor character explains that by helping people and taking on their burdens, you are teaching them to rely on other people's generosity for their survival. And one you have left they may actually be worse off. In contrast she also chastises you for overtly evil acts like winton violence.

This part of the game really made me consider the best way we can use our resources to help elevate those in need. Simply giving someone food or shelter is a temporary measure.

"After having reached every main ending of the game, the story takes a grim turn and leaves you feeling hopeless since pretty much every main character ends up dead or in a complete state of misery. Just as this happens, the credits start to roll and you actually play as a little spaceship shooting the words on screen. However, even now you remain hopeless because it's impossible to win. You lose again and again, having to repeat the same process over and over - pretty much mirroring the hardships the main characters had to go trough - and just as you start to become really frustrated and are about to give up, messages from other players all around the world start to appear. All these messages contain positive thoughts, urging you on to not give up and keep on going. As these messages become more and more, you start to realize that you are not alone in this, there are thousand of others around the globe, stuck in the same struggle that you are - until finally, you get help in form of other spaceships circling around yours, rendering the shooting section, which seemed impossible to overcome just a moment ago, incredibly easy. Thus you beat the final ""boss"", the credits, of the game and get to see the true ending, in which the main characters get reassembled and wake up to live another day.","The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming.

Then Weaver disappeared. As I was immersed in their discussion and wondered what had just happened, I prompted Conway to exit the farmhouse and move to another area and at that very time, silhouettes of musicians appeared in the foreground and they started playing a song.

I was conscripted by an elderly mother to find her four lost children. As the mother stated, each of her children are very ambitious in their own separate way; which in turn gave leads as to where they might be.

"The game is therefore art to me, because its narrative nature conveys emotions very well and sends the player on an emotional journey. 

Roughly speaking, it's about a narrator who shows the developed levels of someone else and thereby draws conclusions about the developer. 

Because of the open narrative style it also tempts more to empathize with the characters and think about how you would have behaved yourself. Thus the game becomes a very personal experience.

The short levels, which all leave a negative impression at first sight, can also mean something completely different on closer inspection.

"The game involved exploring an island through the character of a man who recently lost his wife. While exploring the island, the man reads parts of letters sent to his wife, and slowly the story of his wife's death and of the island itself is revealed, though not wholly so. There is no 'game element' like a puzzle or a high score, and so it does seem questionable as to whether or not this is a game. Exploring the island is purely done on foot, and no running, only a slow walk. It never feels tedious however, as the game world is so intricately made and the dialogue is so engaging that the player is never bored.
The whole game can be played in a few hours. It left me somehow both melancholy and hopeful. The feelings generated from both the dialogue of the man and the images shown in the world were quite profound and stayed in my mind for the next few days. Right from the start, there was no point when I was not engrossed with the game, even though by all metrics it is slow.

"The main plot of the game is that the player characters have unexpectedly found themselves deceased and in Hell, and find out that there is one and only one way to revive themselves from the dead - to defeat Satan in a game of his choice. You spend the majority of the game trying to fulfill this prerequisites you must complete before Satan will accept your challenge. At the very end of the game, when you go to finally challenge Satan, you find that he is in the middle of an intervention for alcoholism by the other residents of Hell. Satan refuses to admit that he has a problem, and challenges the player to a drinking game, which I initially refused to participate in out of not wanting Satan’s substance abuse issues to become worse (I have had people in my life who have had problems with alcohol.) Satan will then inform the player that if they refuse to compete, then they will remain dead forever and will not be revived for being virtuous. I realized immediately due to experiences with other games by this creator that this was not a bluff, but instead a legitimate warning. After losing, Satan will allow you to re-try, and after multiple attempts, I defeated Satan and felt good about having beaten the game, and after seeing the other citizens of Hell react to how I had enabled Satan’s self-destructive behaviour, I started to wonder if I had done the right and just thing. I always like to win, I’m a very competitive person, and I have a deep rooted fear of death and failure (my two biggest fears) - I had defeated my insecurities and accomplished what I set out to, but at the cost of knowing that I had become the kind of destructive presence for Hell that I absolutely despise from people in the real world. It made me think about my own values, and beliefs, and morals, and how they can be set up to conflict with one another.

"The whole game, really, feels like an art piece to me. The world is built and realized so beautifully. Each area of the game is distinct and evokes some kind of feeling - anxiety, calm, happiness, nostalgia. Each area has beautiful, distinct music. Colour is also used to differentiate the areas. The mood is crafted carefully and very successfully. It really is easy to get lost just exploring the world and learning about it. The writing is probably even better, to be honest. The game never tells you outright what happened to the world or what's really going on. Instead it leaves little clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or characters to tell bits and pieces of the story. Once you start figuring out what's going on, you can't stop thinking about it or trying to find out more. It's like reading a good book, except you get to explore it all on your own at your own pace. The game left me with a sense of wonder and a lot of questions to think about. For instance, one of the main conflicts of the game is about sacrifice. Children are sacrificed to become void creatures in order to contain the Radiance, a deadly infection that would wipe out this whole world if left to spread. It's a similar problem to the trolley problem in philosophy.","The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions.

"I consider video games to be ""art"" when the graphics are developed so well that it almost looks realistic. This is especially true when the game takes place in natural spaces, such as a forest or a plateau or a grassy valley. When the game shows the grass blowing in the imaginary breeze with the angle of the sun's rays shining perfectly, that is art. When the colors are vibrant and the color pallet is widely varied, that is art. ","The graphics of the game, the story line, and the character development were done so well that I consider it art.

The sun was setting in the game as I came to the end of the tree tunnel and the world looked so beautiful.  The wind was blowing through the grassy fields and there was a castle in the distance and the trees around me.

"I experienced the game Night in the Woods as art, both as a whole, and in individual moments. I felt that the game very profoundly captured the experience of living in a small provincial town without prospects, and that the game as a whole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals, combined to capture and express this, and then to transform this into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its visuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create an experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics helped me to physically identify with the main character, and encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And the experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk like I would have in my own home town. I think this physical identification helped create space for a psychological identification with a complex and troubled character, meaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In conversations with ""my"" family I wanted to make them happy, but also felt the tension between this and living as ""myself"" in this town, under these emotionally difficult conditions.  The choices in the game are all about building and maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining your identity - they do not affect your ""progress""  or achievements as such - this captures something fundamental about daily life I think - most of our choices are like this. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this feature of life to make it an object of reflection. 


When playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early cinema and the way it was creating a language for itself, and about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and creation, and creative overreach in those films can be. There were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game where I could see a distinct language for games being created in a similar way. In this case a language of agency and constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the medium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness, illusions about our own agency, and the consequences of seemingly minor decisions. 
The light platforming and exploration element is again important in this - it brings an element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite scripted genre (effectively point and click narrative adventures) and this sets up a really effective tension between freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple game mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and expresses the themes and experience of the art.
There is a scene at a party which captures this well - the character does not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and nervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you can only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do not drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time - you have been away from these people for years, feel alienated from the town and constrained by your past behaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of conversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not wanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the knowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this is a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the character, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene written so convincingly that the effect of these forced choices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in the game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't think of another work of art which captures the experience of being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well. The scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and familiar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming conventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in a way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And most interestingly it leverages features of gaming which some have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is a small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works with the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium, to articulate an experience quite forcefully.","The integratedness of the game - how everything (mechanics, writing, worldbuilding, art) works together to create a world and a narrative, in which very particular themes, experiences and ideas can be dealt with. The interesting tension between the way it captures and expresses an experience, and my awareness of its game-ness. That balance between expressing ideas and experiences, and keeping a distance from those things which I think is a feature of all really interesting art.

"The most recent instance where I experienced a digital game as art it was a short (roughly 5-10 minutes) indie game about a person alone on a spaceship. The game's controls are very simple (there is one small choice at the end but otherwise the player can only move the player character around and occasionally interact with pieces of the set), but the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style, and the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player character's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed) person they miss; the player character walks this audience through daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee, tending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a hologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two interacted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are no longer sure of while the hologram degrades. While the letter speaks as though the addressee is alive and the two characters can see each other in the future, the narration has the emotional impact of an exploration of grief. After playing the game I immediately recommended it to some friends, telling them that the experience of playing it felt like the experience of reading a poem.","The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.",poignant and evocative writing; depth of emotion; feeling connected,,,,,,poignant writing; depth of emotion; feeling connected to the player character,143

"I feel like games, as a mixture of things we already consider art (music, literature, cinematography, etc), need to evoke something within the gameplay itself. Undertale does this: the game plays out in a way that recommends you not kill anybody, and doing so gives you a genuinely heartwarming story. It was also marketed specifically as a game where you don't need to kill anyone. But because you can play it multiple times, you could also do the inverse: kill EVERYONE. It invokes a dissonance in the player that only a game could create: you've come to love all these characters, and now you want to see what happens when you personally kill them all. And you have to really try to do it: the game forces you to grind out kills, and throws two incredibly difficult bosses at you (one which explicitly cheats). There are moments where the game points out that you, THE PLAYER, are making these choices. The most poignant of these is once you've finished: you're PERMANENTLY punished for doing the deed; if you do another Pacifist route, the heartwarming scene at the end instead concludes with a stinger and a brief but telltale appearance of the monster you created in the genocide route. ","To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc..

This game created an experience for me that I will treasure. This game also has a unique and beautiful art style. I get the same feelings when I remember this game as I do when I remember a painting or movie I saw, if anything to a greater extent.",lasting impression; memories and feelings; experience to treasure; unique and beautiful art style; evoking feelings similar to paintings or movies,,,,,,emotional attachment; unique and beautiful art style; treasured experience,173
