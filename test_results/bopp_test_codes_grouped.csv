Emotion/Feeling,85,emotional impact,15,70: It made me feel things.,114: The emotional impact.,"27: First thing, the beauty of the view. Such a scene would be beautiful in real life, but seeing it in a game, knowing all the work that was required to show this is mind-blowing. But the valley also brings a lot of feelings, both excitement (to explore this new world) and emptiness, looking at how small you are and peaceful everything looks. Finally, it is one of the first times you see something this big in the game, showing how you progressed in the game, adding to the said feelings. ","30: Graphics aside, what truly made it art was the emotions and the feelings that it evoked. ","36: I can't entirely say, since I don't have a particularly concrete definition (it strikes me as one of those frustratingly vague things like gender, and not something that can clearly be defined in a sentence or two), but it evoked at least as much emotional impact in me as other media experiences (books, movies, etc.) that I know typically are considered art, so it seems to fit to me.","64: It had a profound emotional impact on me which I can still feel to this day, and it made me consider aspects of the human condition which I previously hadn’t. I found the impact to be greater than many books I’ve read and films I’ve watched, because of the unique aspect of actually controlling the character in his journey.","91: Per definition, art is something that is man-made and supposed to primarily provoke thought or emotion. I generally consider video games art, but this moment was especially emotionally provocative.","92: Playing AC Origins felt like art for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was visually captivating. Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes. Much like films are large collaborative pieces of art, I definitely believe video games are as well. ","93: probably the sad day, mixed to the graphics and the overall experience with the world organisation ","104: The author created an interactive story that tells of characters and their stories. Meant to invoce strong emotions and attachment to these characters  with no regard to profitability, marketability, or mass appeal of the game as a product. ","111: The culmination of this game really made it art. You play the whole game as Arthur as he tries to make decisions beneficial to his family/friends without hurting others. This moral struggle follows him the whole game and culminates in the ending with the good or evil ending. The good ending has you fighting off a traitorous friend and fighting him off before Arthur dies. The music, the graphics, the location of his death and everything  leading up to it was simply astonishing ","126: The game made me, without even realizing it, made me prioritize my own goals and desires at the expense of my own personal experiences and the kind of person I would want to be. I won, but the game made me ask myself if winning was worth it. It made me feel and introspect. That is what made the game art.","128: The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.","160: The way it moved me and inspired such strong emotions that even now, just remembering it, it causes me to tear up.",164: There is a deeper motiv to the game or the story than just getting it over with. There are feelings and lessons in it,"70,114,27,30,36,64,91,92,93,104,111,126,128,160,164",10.847409,11.926398,0
Emotion/Feeling,85,emotional response,5,"28: For a game experience to feel like a work of art to me, it would usually be an immersive experience that creates a real emotional response. Since games accomplish this through a combination of illustration, animation, sound, music, storytelling elements all together, I would consider these types of experiences art.","76: It was art because it brought about a deeply emotional response in me, one which was impacted by the perspective of the player. Art, to me, is a purely emotional experience that changes with the perspective of the one experiencing it. Oxenfree fit this description when I played it. ",79: It was something about the way it made me feel. The ability for interpretation felt similar to being in a museum.,"85: Like a film or book, it was clearly intended to elicit an emotional response and tell a story. Unlike some other games, the story was not there to connect the gameplay: rather, the gameplay was there to advance the story.",90: My emotional response to the events that were being depicted and the lingering thoughts and ideas that I was left with after each experience that I had with the game. ,,,,,,,,,,,"28,76,79,85,90",11.155761,11.63366,0
Emotion/Feeling,85,emotional experience,5,13: art to me means that it brings me on a journey and makes me feel. this game brought me on a journey through its narrative and made me feel for the characters. it had its opinion on the subject matter. ,"57: If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those. The basic-looking but gorgeous visuals full of rustic charm and colour, the indie music playing away in the background just over the ambience of life going on as normal, the story perfectly blending in with these elements and ticking away in your mind as you play. It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.  The state of bliss and relaxation at the world, but also emotional investment in the characters and even the town itself was unparalleled to me. ","60: Interacting with creativity (your own, or someone else's, or both), in any way seems to be an artful experience. Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art. Art is often associated with emotional experiences or personal significance. There are probably other things at play that I'm not consciously aware of as well.","125: The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.","168: This game was an experience that filled me with such emotion, presented me with such beauty, and left me with such a lasting impression that all of it in tender has changed my life In a profound way.

Elaborating a little, the game play was not as much of a focus, despite it being a game. It felt more like you were participating in an interactive graphic novel/art project. The emphasis was on the emotions it evoked and connections you felt with the characters -- or rather how you can put yourself very easily in their shoes based on your own experiences with love",,,,,,,,,,,,"122,16,25,89",10.550804,11.469739,0

Emotion/Feeling,85,evoking strong emotions,2,"39: I consider it art as it made me truly and deeply feel something. I can watch a movie stupid. Where I sit there and don’t take any of it in, maybe I laugh at the jokes but at the end I’m not truly moved in anyway. Whereas playing Portal 2 made me truly happy with its comedy and I felt good about myself upon completing puzzles. It’s left a lasting impression that I’ll never forget.","120: The fact that it was able to invoke such strong emotions from me. It resembles a mother awaiting her children who are off at war, only to be returned a flag for solace. To lose everything you cared for on earth and no longer wishing to be apart of it any longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"39,120",9.215946,13.042048,0
Emotion/Feeling,85,emotional journey,2,"10: Art has been defined as ""The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" 
The game I played used the creation of digital graphics to tell a story that had immense emotional power. And I believe in this case the reason to play this game would be primarily for that emotional journey. The gameplay isn't anything to shout about, the puzzles are pretty simple. Therefore I believe it falls into that definition.","58: In my opinion, art is a form of communicating emotion in abstract ways, whether through a painting or a piece of music. This game was an incredibly emotional journey that I felt very connected to despite never being told what to feel. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10,58",10.9264765,10.878272,0
Emotion/Feeling,85,emotional investment,2,"53: I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic. I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings. I also found the writing and stories compelling and it was easy for me to be emotionally invested in it, in the way I would be invested in a well-written book.","57: If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those.

Emotion/Feeling,85,emotional challenge,2,"9: Art as a concept is huge, I think there is a little bit of art in everything. Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, I think real art challenges you in some way or holds up a mirror to reflect in. Firewatch both challenged me emotionally, and caused some deep introspection about relationships.","59: In order to advance in the game, the player has to exploit the planet's resources and mark its surface. It encapsulates the conflict inherent in advancing standards of living by exploiting nature.

Emotion/Feeling,85,serenity,1,"165: There was something very serene and beautiful about being elevated and getting to see the rest of this particular level of the game. However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world. So to me personally, In that sense, gaming is most like art when it imitates real life - when it makes me feel as though I am simply one small part of something bigger.

Emotion/Feeling,85,making the player feel something,1,"31: Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle.

I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82,10.796611,11.592739,0

Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes. Much like films are large collaborative pieces of art, I definitely believe video games are as well. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,92,7.5545034,4.4743743,7

Visual aesthetics,56,simplicity of art style,1,"124: The game involves some very interesting themes such as becoming an adult, mental illnesses, accepting change, and questions existence and life and our place in the universe.

I no longer saw the graphics as a way to play the game or as a way to learn something about the game, but as something else entirely. I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way.

It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar.

Visual aesthetics,56,beauty of visuals,1,"27: First thing, the beauty of the view. Such a scene would be beautiful in real life, but seeing it in a game, knowing all the work that was required to show this is mind-blowing. But the valley also brings a lot of feelings, both excitement (to explore this new world) and emptiness, looking at how small you are and peaceful everything looks.

You play the whole game as Arthur as he tries to make decisions beneficial to his family/friends without hurting others. This moral struggle follows him the whole game and culminates in the ending with the good or evil ending. The good ending has you fighting off a traitorous friend and fighting him off before Arthur dies.

I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings.

Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art. Art is often associated with emotional experiences or personal significance. There are probably other things at play that I'm not consciously aware of as well.","65: It is a basic murder mystery/logic puzzle.

The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.","140: The mix between exceptionally good story telling and philosophy and the beautiful, yet apocalyptic, surroundings.",,,,,,,,,"33,60,65,96,98,125,140",13.019363,9.408772,3

The experience was true to life as it depicted Geralt’s reality in shades of gray rather than being simply black and white, good and evil, etc. One of art’s tendencies is to reflect back to us who we are and what we do in an angle we might not have considered before.

Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction.

Immersion,18,immersion,11,135: The immersion ,"40: I consider it art because it reads like a movie and the graphics allow for me to feel immersed as if it was a real life story. It's still a game because it's interactive, but if it was turned into an animated picture, it would still have the same effect and immersion.","54: I view video games, along with books, paintings, tv series and movies as art.
Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction.","57: If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those. The basic-looking but gorgeous visuals full of rustic charm and colour, the indie music playing away in the background just over the ambience of life going on as normal, the story perfectly blending in with these elements and ticking away in your mind as you play. It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.  The state of bliss and relaxation at the world, but also emotional investment in the characters and even the town itself was unparalleled to me. ","81: It was visually beautiful, immersive and made me ignore the horrible mechanics that would have otherwise ruined it.","93: probably the sad day, mixed to the graphics and the overall experience with the world organisation ","100: The ability to easily become totally immersed and lost within the game, and lose my thoughts and just appreciate whatever it is that I am immersed in. That is art.","117: The experience was very immersive, it was formed of an intriguing combination of symbols that were left unexplained and it was surprising and perfectly timed.","128: The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.",151: The soundtrack and the immersion of the game,"165: There was something very serene and beautiful about being elevated and getting to see the rest of this particular level of the game. However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world. So to me personally, In that sense, gaming is most like art when it imitates real life - when it makes me feel as though I am simply one small part of something bigger.

Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art.

Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped.

Game design,16,gameplay as primary consideration,1,"169: To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,169,8.208413,7.405129,17

It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art.

Game design,16,doing instead of telling,1,"31: Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle.

I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82,10.025635,8.59578,17

Artistic value,15,fitting traditional definition of art,1,"50: I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50,7.5004554,7.5691338,11

Reflection,14,reflection,3,"1: ""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.","9: Art as a concept is huge, I think there is a little bit of art in everything. Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, I think real art challenges you in some way or holds up a mirror to reflect in. Firewatch both challenged me emotionally, and caused some deep introspection about relationships.","12: Art should make us think and reflect.

I think this game did just that in my experience. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41,8.676949,11.318324,5
Critical thinking,11,questioning values,1,"126: The game made me, without even realizing it, made me prioritize my own goals and desires at the expense of my own personal experiences and the kind of person I would want to be. I won, but the game made me ask myself if winning was worth it. It made me feel and introspect. That is what made the game art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,126,2.1234713,12.512424,5
Critical thinking,11,questioning and struggling with deeper themes,1,"31: Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle. Media that makes you struggle with these questions I think is the definition of good art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31,2.1333761,12.479479,5
Critical thinking,11,meta-commentary on video games,1,80: It was the first that came to mind because there was more to it than just gameplay and story. It was trying to say something about the videogames themselves and how a player think and perceive. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,9.520007,7.2524385,5
Critical thinking,11,critique of gamer culture,1,"50: I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50,9.426598,7.1939697,5

Creator effort,8,message from developers,1,"54: I view video games, along with books, paintings, tv series and movies as art.
Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54,7.565186,9.195797,57

The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.","168: This game was an experience that filled me with such emotion, presented me with such beauty, and left me with such a lasting impression that all of it in tender has changed my life In a profound way.

Innovation,7,subversion of RPG tropes,1,"169: To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc..

Innovation,7,integration of game elements,1,"136: The integratedness of the game - how everything (mechanics, writing, worldbuilding, art) works together to create a world and a narrative, in which very particular themes, experiences and ideas can be dealt with.

That balance between expressing ideas and experiences, and keeping a distance from those things which I think is a feature of all really interesting art.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,136,10.254001,8.542067,29
Innovation,7,innovation in storytelling,1,42: I consider this experience as art for two reasons.

Nearly a year later, I still think about what this game was trying to say, and any media that leaves such an impression is surely artistic.","39: I consider it art as it made me truly and deeply feel something. I can watch a movie stupid. Where I sit there and don’t take any of it in, maybe I laugh at the jokes but at the end I’m not truly moved in anyway.

While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50,8.685267,9.167509,73
Empathy,4,empathy with characters,2,"68: It made me experience feelings that I had rarely if ever encountered on other media. Playing as the characters makes you able to emphatise with them and through their actions the artists are able to convey complex messages and emotions. When well executed, I think the player is not merely a spectator, but a ""cable"" that feels the energy passing through","89: Mostly what I described above. Elaborating a little, the game play was not as much of a focus, despite it being a game. It felt more like you were participating in an interactive graphic novel/art project. The emphasis was on the emotions it evoked and connections you felt with the characters -- or rather how you can put yourself very easily in their shoes based on your own experiences with love",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"68,89",10.420021,10.0048685,18
Empathy,4,empathy with the main character,1,"1: ""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,10.454354,10.069411,18
Empathy,4,empathy,1,"116: The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming.

Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped.

However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world.

I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way.

I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art.

And the possibility offer different meanings to the same games elements ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,144,12.594194,9.214449,54
Interaction,2,interaction with themes,1,"31: Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle. Media that makes you struggle with these questions I think is the definition of good art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31,8.593982,9.02132,63
Interaction,2,interaction,1,"54: I view video games, along with books, paintings, tv series and movies as art.
Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54,8.658436,8.860009,63
Inspiration,2,inspiration,2,7: Any piece of work can be considered art so long as it inspires thought or emotion.

Genre,2,walking simulator,1,"167: This game is mainly a walking simulator, so there is limited gameplay, but the gameplay that is present is directly related to the current narrative. The gameplay drives the story along and doesn't/can't exist on its own. The game felt like an animated short movie that you would normally just watch, but you get to walk through it at your own pace and drive the narrative yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,167,9.513181,8.085538,22
Genre,2,horror,1,63: It felt like the art style had no intention of catering to anyones pleasure. It seemd like an experiment in which the horror derived from self purpose rather than trying achieve some sort of representation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,63,7.3531265,7.4158564,22

Engaging,2,compelling,1,"131: The graphics of the game, the story line, and the character development were done so well that I consider it art.

Diversity,2,opening doors for discussions about diverse games as art,1,"50: I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50,9.302368,6.972211,50

Conflict,2,good vs. evil,1,"111: The culmination of this game really made it art. You play the whole game as Arthur as he tries to make decisions beneficial to his family/friends without hurting others. This moral struggle follows him the whole game and culminates in the ending with the good or evil ending. The good ending has you fighting off a traitorous friend and fighting him off before Arthur dies.

Conflict,2,conflict,1,"59: In order to advance in the game, the player has to exploit the planet's resources and mark its surface. It encapsulates the conflict inherent in advancing standards of living by exploiting nature. The player doesn't even know where the outputs are going, just that their employer, Ficsit Corporation, requires them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59,8.051764,7.868811,70
Commentary,2,commentary on gaming mechanics,1,"169: To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,169,9.563389,7.1963987,87
Commentary,2,commentary on culture,1,"46: I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything I’ve seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar. I liked that even through the chaos and destruction brought about by players and NPCs, the sunshine never went away, and the whole world had this constant “gloss” that made it perfect.

Cinematic,2,cinematic quality,1,"40: I consider it art because it reads like a movie and the graphics allow for me to feel immersed as if it was a real life story. It's still a game because it's interactive, but if it was turned into an animated picture, it would still have the same effect and immersion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,7.0776877,5.351039,38

Characterization,2,believable characters,1,"163: The writing already is a work of art, it's crafted in such a thoughtful and intelligent way that makes you feel immersed in the moment. The set design is phenomenal as all the spectacle that you see is literally and figuratively out of this world. You can feel the wonder and fear of every turn, the crew feel alive and believable. The sound design and choice of sounds are perfect. This game is exactly the combination of all forms of art into one experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,163,10.323518,9.713657,90
Challenge,2,challenging player's perception,1,80: It was the first that came to mind because there was more to it than just gameplay and story. It was trying to say something about the videogames themselves and how a player think and perceive. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80,4.7818365,10.391153,91

Accomplishment,2,sense of accomplishment,2,"27: First thing, the beauty of the view. Such a scene would be beautiful in real life, but seeing it in a game, knowing all the work that was required to show this is mind-blowing. But the valley also brings a lot of feelings, both excitement (to explore this new world) and emptiness, looking at how small you are and peaceful everything looks. Finally, it is one of the first times you see something this big in the game, showing how you progressed in the game, adding to the said feelings. ","110: The connections made , the emotional attachments cultivated, and mostly the balance struck between button mashing and true real feel action. When your choices carry over from series to series, and in the finale' your in a better position because you had wisdom and thought ahead it's a glorious feeling.

Other,36,sensory experience,1,"161: The way that the music, colour palette, and ambiance enhanced the game mechanics. It also featured classical piano pieces that I think added to the artistic feel.

It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling.

Other,36,appreciation for the creators,1,"56: I was young, so at the time, this title stood apart. The sun has a face and it wants to hurt you. A raccoon tail let you fly!

Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes. Much like films are large collaborative pieces of art, I definitely believe video games are as well. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,92,9.218589,8.390716,88
Other,36,coherent whole,1,"82: It's one of those game that are loaded with emotional implications, make a clever and conscious use of game mechanics, and where every aspect of the game supports every other aspect of the game and the overall play experience. I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82,11.713537,8.44435,89

Other,36,critical analysis,1,"12: Art should make us think and reflect.

Other,36,altruism in gaming,1,"116: The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming. Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped. I had never seen a truly altruistic action performed by another player in a video game - up until this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,116,9.163653,7.5799417,94
