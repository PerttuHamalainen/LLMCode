"the richness of pictures/drawings.
- there was almost no text
- it was me who made the art come together","self-expression,  art style,  analogous to other forms of art",15.0
"I believe video games are art. It doesn't feel right to check off features to qualify for being art. The creators clearly intended it to be so, so it is.","art,  all games are art,  realism",13.0
I felt the work had a sort of beauty in how well it was put together.,"beauty,  beautiful graphics,  beautiful",12.0
"Art leaves the user to reflect and interpret on it. While I have played many games that I would consider works of art (be it because the graphics were exciting, or the game play was so masterful that it left me amazed, or that the story and visuals left me contemplative), this particular game felt especially impactful. Nearly a year later, I still think about what this game was trying to say, and any media that leaves such an impression is surely artistic.","lasting impression,  immersion,  immersive",8.0
"The connections made , the emotional attachments cultivated, and mostly the balance struck between button mashing and true real feel action. When your choices carry over from series to series, and in the finale' your in a better position because you had wisdom and thought ahead it's a glorious feeling. ","series connection,  empathy with the main character,  empathy with characters",7.0
How the game and world looked so good.,"visuals,  visual space,  visual pleasure",7.0
"It evoked some sort of feeling in me. To be art, it has to be able to make people feel things at the bare minimum.","something new and beautiful,  different type of experience,  young",7.0
"As before: it was engaging, thought-provoking, very distinct and often unenjoyable - a work of art that I appreciate aesthetically yet also find numerous flaws with","unenjoyable,  quality of the worst,  no regard for profitability",6.0
"Combination of art style, music and where this comes in the game narrative.","music,  well fitted music,  captivating music",6.0
"Any media that makes the users/viewer think, challenges ones believe is art. Art isn't just pretty pictures but so much more. ","thought-provoking,  thoughts and ideas left after playing,  thought or emotion provocation",5.0
"""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.","reflection,  trying to say something about videogames,  reflection on life",5.0
"First of all, it is the uncommon atmosphere I noted above.
The other thing is the message this game tries to send to the players.
That victory isn't always great, and sometimes it is the wrong thing you do, even if it looks good in the beginning.","message,  context of playing,  meaningful end to the game",5.0
"The scenario because of the colours it used, the design of the environment, the music it involved and the different events that made it more exciting. ","environment,  atmosphere,  perfect visuals",5.0
i think it's a unique thing to video games as in how the mechanics of gameplay create a story of their that each person experiences distinctly,"unique,  uniqueness,  unique style of art",4.0
"The scene had both stunning visuals and audio, and it invoked a sense of nostalgy and longing, just like watching or listening to some other pieces of art might do.","nostalgia,  moving,  memory",4.0
The graphics and the story.,"graphics,  style,  mixed with graphics and experience",4.0
"The fact that it was able to invoke such strong emotions from me. It resembles a mother awaiting her children who are off at war, only to be returned a flag for solace. To lose everything you cared for on earth and no longer wishing to be apart of it any longer.","strong emotions,  powerful emotional experience,  inspiring strong emotions",3.0
The visual aesthetics combined with the purpose of the game. the graphics really succeeded in setting the overall feeling.,"setting the overall feeling,  questioning the authority of the player,  moving the viewer to connect with the art",3.0
"I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything Ive seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar. I liked that even through the chaos and destruction brought about by players and NPCs, the sunshine never went away, and the whole world had this constant gloss that made it perfect. ","world with a ""gloss"",  world design,  world building",3.0
The level of detail and vast depth of description given.,"vast depth of description,  depth of emotion,  deeper motiv",3.0
"Soundtrack, narrative told through exploring the world and items","soundtrack,  sound design,  music/sounds",3.0
"The slowness, storyline, drawing style and music/sounds of the game made it feel very artistic. ","slow-paced,  serenity,  sense of relaxation",3.0
"The amazing attention to detail in the visual space, from architecture/infrastructure, wildlife and plants, geographic/environmental features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, forests and prairies. ","attention to detail,  detail put into environment,  detail in characters",3.0
"The questions it raised and the highly emotional connection that emerged between me and the game, the experience.","questions,  philosophy,  philosophical thesis",2.0
It was the first that came to mind because there was more to it than just gameplay and story. It was trying to say something about the videogames themselves and how a player think and perceive. ,"player thought and perception,  player control,  player as ""cable""",2.0
"I consider it art because it reads like a movie and the graphics allow for me to feel immersed as if it was a real life story. It's still a game because it's interactive, but if it was turned into an animated picture, it would still have the same effect and immersion.","interactive,  interaction with creativity,  interaction and influence over the plot",2.0
"The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming. Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped. I had never seen a truly altruistic action performed by another player in a video game - up until this point.","feeling of being helped by a complete stranger,  feeling a part of something bigger,  emotional challenge",2.0
"The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.","engaging gameplay,  engaging,  engagement",2.0
"The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.","writing,  voice acting,  emotional journey",31.0
