The ludnonarrative harmony.","111: The culmination of this game really made it art. You play the whole game as Arthur as he tries to make decisions beneficial to his family/friends without hurting others. This moral struggle follows him the whole game and culminates in the ending with the good or evil ending.

immersion,6,135: The immersion ,"40: I consider it art because it reads like a movie and the graphics allow for me to feel immersed as if it was a real life story. It's still a game because it's interactive, but if it was turned into an animated picture, it would still have the same effect and immersion.","57: If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those. The basic-looking but gorgeous visuals full of rustic charm and colour, the indie music playing away in the background just over the ambience of life going on as normal, the story perfectly blending in with these elements and ticking away in your mind as you play. It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.  The state of bliss and relaxation at the world, but also emotional investment in the characters and even the town itself was unparalleled to me.

storytelling,5,"33: I believe storytelling and creating a world are a form of art. Playing the game feels like taking part in an interactive story. I compare it to reading, but the story is conveyed differently and lets me choose.","60: Interacting with creativity (your own, or someone else's, or both), in any way seems to be an artful experience. Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art. Art is often associated with emotional experiences or personal significance. There are probably other things at play that I'm not consciously aware of as well.","96: Soundtrack, way of storytelling","98: Story telling, visuals, voice acting and the fact that I felt connected to the protagonist.","125: The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling.

While I have played many games that I would consider works of art (be it because the graphics were exciting, or the game play was so masterful that it left me amazed, or that the story and visuals left me contemplative), this particular game felt especially impactful. Nearly a year later, I still think about what this game was trying to say, and any media that leaves such an impression is surely artistic.","39: I consider it art as it made me truly and deeply feel something. I can watch a movie stupid. Where I sit there and don’t take any of it in, maybe I laugh at the jokes but at the end I’m not truly moved in anyway. Whereas playing Portal 2 made me truly happy with its comedy and I felt good about myself upon completing puzzles.

immersive experience,4,"28: For a game experience to feel like a work of art to me, it would usually be an immersive experience that creates a real emotional response. Since games accomplish this through a combination of illustration, animation, sound, music, storytelling elements all together, I would consider these types of experiences art.","117: The experience was very immersive, it was formed of an intriguing combination of symbols that were left unexplained and it was surprising and perfectly timed.","128: The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.","163: The writing already is a work of art, it's crafted in such a thoughtful and intelligent way that makes you feel immersed in the moment.

Firstly, it was visually captivating. Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes. Much like films are large collaborative pieces of art, I definitely believe video games are as well.

video games as art,2,"54: I view video games, along with books, paintings, tv series and movies as art.
Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction.","91: Per definition, art is something that is man-made and supposed to primarily provoke thought or emotion.

unique emotional experience,2,"68: It made me experience feelings that I had rarely if ever encountered on other media.

reflection,2,"1: ""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.","9: Art as a concept is huge, I think there is a little bit of art in everything. Aside from being aesthetically pleasing, I think real art challenges you in some way or holds up a mirror to reflect in. Firewatch both challenged me emotionally, and caused some deep introspection about relationships.",,,,,,,"1,9",0.1737693,9.803633
pushing boundaries,2,42: I consider this experience as art for two reasons. One is that it is extremely innovative and helps to push the boundaries of storytelling in video games and thus matures the entire medium. The other is that it has a deeper and more complex emotional layer that can be interpreted in many ways.,127: The game pushed the boundaries of the medium and made me reflect on myself and the human condition.,,,,,,,"42,127",9.522834,9.567438

emotional journey,2,"10: Art has been defined as ""The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" 
The game I played used the creation of digital graphics to tell a story that had immense emotional power. And I believe in this case the reason to play this game would be primarily for that emotional journey. The gameplay isn't anything to shout about, the puzzles are pretty simple. Therefore I believe it falls into that definition.","58: In my opinion, art is a form of communicating emotion in abstract ways, whether through a painting or a piece of music.

emotional investment,2,"53: I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic. I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings. I also found the writing and stories compelling and it was easy for me to be emotionally invested in it, in the way I would be invested in a well-written book.","57: If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those.

It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar. I liked that even through the chaos and destruction brought about by players and NPCs, the sunshine never went away, and the whole world had this constant “gloss” that made it perfect.

attention to detail,2,"61: It brought something different to a game, it made me feel strong emotions, it engaged me fully and still has me daydreaming about it weeks later. A lot of detail was put into engaging players.",103: the attention to detail and the appreciation of hours devoted to making it look so,,,,,,,"61,103",9.6337385,5.9809017
appreciation of effort,2,103: the attention to detail and the appreciation of hours devoted to making it look so,"156: The things that made me consider this experience art was my understanding and appreciation of the effort and time of took to give the player the unique experience the game was aiming for. A seamless marriage between gameplay, sound track, and level composition. ",,,,,,,"103,156",12.488976,7.885664
all games are art,2,"19: As stated above, there is literally nothing a video game could do to NOT be art. Art is not a judgement of merit. ","94: really all video games are art, but from me to truly enjoy the art I need to be fully engaged in its world ",,,,,,,"19,94",10.192162,10.685705
aesthetic pleasure,2,75: It was aesthetically pleasing and I had dreams about it after finishing it,"128: The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.",,,,,,,"75,128",9.898279,8.02118
writing,1,"4: All the parts of the game when considered as a whole. When you take in consideration the music, the graphic design, the writing, and of course the gameplay. Its in games like this when you are aware of be playing an artwork, rather than just another game. ",,,,,,,,4,9.576931,9.884869
wrestling with social issues,1,"41: I consider this experience artistic because like any film or book or painting, it told a story that was deeply meaningful. The narrative of the game and its writing wrestled with issues of morality, class, racism, sexism, and many other topics in ways that many other video games have been afraid to touch. The experience was true to life as it depicted Geralt’s reality in shades of gray rather than being simply black and white, good and evil, etc. One of art’s tendencies is to reflect back to us who we are and what we do in an angle we might not have considered before. I think this game did just that in my experience. ",,,,,,,,41,9.314706,12.163467

wonder and fear,1,"163: The writing already is a work of art, it's crafted in such a thoughtful and intelligent way that makes you feel immersed in the moment. The set design is phenomenal as all the spectacle that you see is literally and figuratively out of this world. You can feel the wonder and fear of every turn, the crew feel alive and believable. The sound design and choice of sounds are perfect. This game is exactly the combination of all forms of art into one experience.",,,,,,,,163,6.1109405,8.110905

well-written,1,"92: Playing AC Origins felt like art for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was visually captivating. Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes. Much like films are large collaborative pieces of art, I definitely believe video games are as well. ",,,,,,,,92,4.9447246,11.988786
well-fitted music,1,"154: The story was building around you without any real hint at what was actually going on, until you reach the point where you find out what the actual plot and setting is, then realize what your actions actually meant. Coupled with a dramatic visual setting and well fitted music.",,,,,,,,154,11.992605,4.0926175

visual style,1,"49: I guess simply because the entire game looks like a drawing, and as an artist I really enjoyed that. People seem to want art to always be something deeper, but I just enjoy good drawings.",,,,,,,,49,10.153946,8.464109
visual pleasure,1,71: It managed to spark my curiosity while being visually pleasing.,,,,,,,,71,10.235808,7.9314027
visual experience,1,158: The way it looks and how you get to experience it and explore the different terrain makes me feel like I’m in a huge art gallery. Everything is meant to be looked at and explored with the intent that it is living art.,,,,,,,,158,10.217259,8.222813
visual appeal,1,"24: Defining what art is is super subjective, but to me this counted because 1. people had to create those graphics, and 2 . I liked it and thought it was pretty (which yes, is not necessary for art,)",,,,,,,,24,10.3578005,7.901843
visual and emotional beauty,1,"44: I didn't care about the gameplay or mechanics; I was motivated entirely by the visual and emotional beauty, and the emotional experience was so powerful that I still feel strongly when I reflect on the experience. To me, that emotion & beauty driven experience makes it art.",,,,,,,,44,10.538388,7.753555
video games as an art form,1,"129: The gameplay, the music, the world design, all of it. Video games are an art form of itself.",,,,,,,,129,10.151035,10.746527
video games and movies as art,1,"72: It reminded me more of a movie than a video game, and I think both are art in general.",,,,,,,,72,10.335164,10.781383
vibrant colors,1,"131: The graphics of the game, the story line, and the character development were done so well that I consider it art. The graphics are seemingly flawless, with the sun light angles being presented realistically, the colors are vibrant and varied, the story is compelling, the scenery itself tells a story (with the machine coming our of the mountain)...

unique interactive experience,1,"64: It had a profound emotional impact on me which I can still feel to this day, and it made me consider aspects of the human condition which I previously hadn’t. I found the impact to be greater than many books I’ve read and films I’ve watched, because of the unique aspect of actually controlling the character in his journey.",,,,,,,,64,7.950535,7.787355

unique gameplay mechanics,1,52: i think it's a unique thing to video games as in how the mechanics of gameplay create a story of their that each person experiences distinctly,,,,,,,,52,8.061973,7.601943
unique feelings,1,123: The feelings it gave me. I've never felt that way from movies or games or music. Art is the only explanation.,,,,,,,,123,5.7551637,7.964271
unique experience,1,3: All the elements being combined to give me this unique experience.,,,,,,,,3,7.928147,7.632719
unique artistic style,1,"53: I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic. I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings. I also found the writing and stories compelling and it was easy for me to be emotionally invested in it, in the way I would be invested in a well-written book.",,,,,,,,53,8.294598,7.456282
unique and creative,1,"56: I was young, so at the time, this title stood apart. The sun has a face and it wants to hurt you. A raccoon tail let you fly! It was thinking that someone (at the time I probably didn't know that a team of people made this) had to make this, be this creative. ",,,,,,,,56,8.216131,7.623869
unique and beautiful art style,1,"173: Whenever I remember this game I am flooded with memories and feelings I have attached to it. This game created an experience for me that I will treasure.

uncovering existing art,1,139: The meaning of the story was open to interpretation but felt significant regardless of how you interpreted it. There was a feeling that you were just revealing a story that already existed and experiencing art by uncovering it yourself rather than making something yourself with the game.,,,,,,,,139,6.3923717,10.857331
uncommon atmosphere,1,"26: First of all, it is the uncommon atmosphere I noted above.
The other thing is the message this game tries to send to the players.
That victory isn't always great, and sometimes it is the wrong thing you do, even if it looks good in the beginning.",,,,,,,,26,8.6233635,7.6367207
truth,1,"12: Art should make us think and reflect. Art should be able to be analyzed critically and should tell us something about ourselves or the person(s) who create the art--things cultural, personal, historical, etc. Art is an artifact that encodes the spectrum of our humanity and asks us to face this truth.",,,,,,,,12,8.381375,9.361097

traumatic and painful subject matter,1,"125: The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.",,,,,,,,125,3.9144058,8.979305
transcending the medium,1,"20: Because it transcended the game itself. Normally a game is the medium that you interpret a story or something through, but this felt like it was directly to me without any translation.",,,,,,,,20,7.9368167,8.728034

"themes of becoming an adult, mental illnesses, accepting change, and existential questions",1,"124: The game involves some very interesting themes such as becoming an adult, mental illnesses, accepting change, and questions existence and life and our place in the universe. The art style itself is also very lovely, with cute anthropomorphic animal characters, but I think its simplicity helps a player to focus on the narrative and the themes better, as it did for me.

tediousness reinforcing decision,1,"169: To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.",,,,,,,,169,9.010167,9.211865

story with emotional power,1,"10: Art has been defined as ""The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" 
The game I played used the creation of digital graphics to tell a story that had immense emotional power. And I believe in this case the reason to play this game would be primarily for that emotional journey. The gameplay isn't anything to shout about, the puzzles are pretty simple. Therefore I believe it falls into that definition.",,,,,,,,10,5.965573,11.820642

similar to going to a gallery,1,"119: The fact that it gave me the same feeling as going to a gallery. A broadening of understanding, and a new perspective on events I have never seen (although art can be something I relate to as well, in this case it wasn't because I've never been in a warzone). ",,,,,,,,119,8.759347,8.471192
significant story,1,139: The meaning of the story was open to interpretation but felt significant regardless of how you interpreted it.

serene and beautiful,1,"165: There was something very serene and beautiful about being elevated and getting to see the rest of this particular level of the game. However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world. So to me personally, In that sense, gaming is most like art when it imitates real life - when it makes me feel as though I am simply one small part of something bigger. ",,,,,,,,165,10.888229,6.75066
sensory experience,1,"161: The way that the music, colour palette, and ambiance enhanced the game mechanics. It also featured classical piano pieces that I think added to the artistic feel.

sense of progress,1,"27: First thing, the beauty of the view. Such a scene would be beautiful in real life, but seeing it in a game, knowing all the work that was required to show this is mind-blowing. But the valley also brings a lot of feelings, both excitement (to explore this new world) and emptiness, looking at how small you are and peaceful everything looks. Finally, it is one of the first times you see something this big in the game, showing how you progressed in the game, adding to the said feelings. ",,,,,,,,27,8.341077,8.663756
sense of despair,1,"109: The competition between different pressures (described above), and possibly the drab color pallette and pixelation, made me feel a sense of despair that would not be possible outside of art, absent real personal tragedy.",,,,,,,,109,6.3579135,7.2825284

While I have played many games that I would consider works of art (be it because the graphics were exciting, or the game play was so masterful that it left me amazed, or that the story and visuals left me contemplative), this particular game felt especially impactful. Nearly a year later, I still think about what this game was trying to say, and any media that leaves such an impression is surely artistic.",,,,,,,,11,0.33224452,9.663227
realism,1,"46: I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything I’ve seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar. I liked that even through the chaos and destruction brought about by players and NPCs, the sunshine never went away, and the whole world had this constant “gloss” that made it perfect. ",,,,,,,,46,8.419609,9.334697
questions raised,1,"146: The questions it raised and the highly emotional connection that emerged between me and the game, the experience.",,,,,,,,146,10.64627,14.351395
questioning values,1,"126: The game made me, without even realizing it, made me prioritize my own goals and desires at the expense of my own personal experiences and the kind of person I would want to be. I won, but the game made me ask myself if winning was worth it. It made me feel and introspect. That is what made the game art.",,,,,,,,126,10.600239,14.313351
questioning player authority,1,"166: This game felt like art because it questioned the authority of the player, you WERE playing, but then also not really, that was very new
to me at the time, where most games had pretty clear rules and objectives and influences from other media forms were unheard of",,,,,,,,166,10.616389,14.311919
questioning ethical and philosophical concepts,1,"31: Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle. Media that makes you struggle with these questions I think is the definition of good art.",,,,,,,,31,10.355789,14.226898
questioning actions,1,"171: Well it differed from a lot of other games. Instead of a game about just reaching your goal, this game made you question why you were reaching your goal, everything had a meaning. I’ve played lots of games but that was the first one that made me think about my actions throughout the game ",,,,,,,,171,10.603002,14.309038
quality of the game,1,"145: The quality of the worst that was put in as well as the over all experience of playing the game. The message also helped. It wasnt just a save the world type situation or a shoot and kill type game, even though technically it is a linear railroaded type game, it still gave you some agency of interpretation which I think is present in all art.",,,,,,,,145,8.826348,9.566204
purely emotional experience,1,"76: It was art because it brought about a deeply emotional response in me, one which was impacted by the perspective of the player. Art, to me, is a purely emotional experience that changes with the perspective of the one experiencing it. Oxenfree fit this description when I played it. ",,,,,,,,76,4.8453465,8.404688
provoking emotional and intellectual reaction,1,"14: Art, regardless of media, should provoke an emotional or intellectual reaction. This game provoked both",,,,,,,,14,3.9681797,9.483236
provoking emotion and thought,1,"73: It took a philosopher/scientists theory, expanded on it, and used it to provoke emotion and thought through their selected medium.",,,,,,,,73,3.9909723,9.583219
profound emotional impact,1,"64: It had a profound emotional impact on me which I can still feel to this day, and it made me consider aspects of the human condition which I previously hadn’t. I found the impact to be greater than many books I’ve read and films I’ve watched, because of the unique aspect of actually controlling the character in his journey.",,,,,,,,64,3.931594,8.755508
pride in creation,1,43: I consider what I have made within the game to be my art. I showed it off proudly as I would do with other forms of art that I have created.,,,,,,,,43,9.720203,9.469589
powerful emotional experience,1,"44: I didn't care about the gameplay or mechanics; I was motivated entirely by the visual and emotional beauty, and the emotional experience was so powerful that I still feel strongly when I reflect on the experience. To me, that emotion & beauty driven experience makes it art.",,,,,,,,44,4.5205383,8.528336
poignant writing,1,"143: The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.",,,,,,,,143,4.9426723,11.988973
plot twist,1,"154: The story was building around you without any real hint at what was actually going on, until you reach the point where you find out what the actual plot and setting is, then realize what your actions actually meant. Coupled with a dramatic visual setting and well fitted music.",,,,,,,,154,6.117606,12.538269
playing with RPG tropes,1,"169: To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.",,,,,,,,169,8.660151,10.126462
player choices affecting outcome,1,"107: The choices I made affected the outcome, and there were themes to the story that stuck with me once I was done playing. The graphics were also artistically done and beautiful.",,,,,,,,107,8.963681,10.346513
player as active participant,1,"68: It made me experience feelings that I had rarely if ever encountered on other media. Playing as the characters makes you able to emphatise with them and through their actions the artists are able to convey complex messages and emotions. When well executed, I think the player is not merely a spectator, but a ""cable"" that feels the energy passing through",,,,,,,,68,8.013612,9.932081
played for the story,1,"38: I consider books, movies and other storytelling mediums as art, I played the game for the story ",,,,,,,,38,5.920955,12.406414
plants,1,"101: The amazing attention to detail in the visual space, from architecture/infrastructure, wildlife and plants, geographic/environmental features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, forests and prairies. ",,,,,,,,101,10.904285,10.070134
philosophical/scientific theory,1,"73: It took a philosopher/scientists theory, expanded on it, and used it to provoke emotion and thought through their selected medium.",,,,,,,,73,10.172802,14.240192
philosophical thesis,1,"170: Well drawn narrative, excellent atmosphere, good soundtrack, while also sporting an actual philosophical thesis on the nature of humans in an objectivist 'utopia'",,,,,,,,170,10.196367,14.247341
philosophical and ethical questions,1,137: The level of depth and complexity of the deeply ingrained philisophical and ethical questions it both poses to the player and explores within its narrative combine in such a way that calling it anything but art is a disservice to what it is,,,,,,,,137,10.243277,14.220591
phenomenal set design,1,"163: The writing already is a work of art, it's crafted in such a thoughtful and intelligent way that makes you feel immersed in the moment. The set design is phenomenal as all the spectacle that you see is literally and figuratively out of this world. You can feel the wonder and fear of every turn, the crew feel alive and believable. The sound design and choice of sounds are perfect. This game is exactly the combination of all forms of art into one experience.",,,,,,,,163,10.077204,6.7073684
perspective of the player,1,"76: It was art because it brought about a deeply emotional response in me, one which was impacted by the perspective of the player. Art, to me, is a purely emotional experience that changes with the perspective of the one experiencing it. Oxenfree fit this description when I played it. ",,,,,,,,76,8.969778,9.572441
personal significance,1,"60: Interacting with creativity (your own, or someone else's, or both), in any way seems to be an artful experience. Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art. Art is often associated with emotional experiences or personal significance. There are probably other things at play that I'm not consciously aware of as well.",,,,,,,,60,6.5135875,8.841214
personal feelings,1,121: The feelings I felt while playing and the complete different feelings others felt while playing. ,,,,,,,,121,5.8042526,8.04028
personal enjoyment,1,"24: Defining what art is is super subjective, but to me this counted because 1. people had to create those graphics, and 2 . I liked it and thought it was pretty (which yes, is not necessary for art,)",,,,,,,,24,9.721703,8.107786
personal creation,1,43: I consider what I have made within the game to be my art. I showed it off proudly as I would do with other forms of art that I have created.,,,,,,,,43,6.7708435,8.824303
personal connection,1,"58: In my opinion, art is a form of communicating emotion in abstract ways, whether through a painting or a piece of music. This game was an incredibly emotional journey that I felt very connected to despite never being told what to feel. ",,,,,,,,58,6.451265,8.921261
perfect world,1,"46: I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything I’ve seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar.

",,,,,,,,46,10.393519,6.5878415
perfect visuals,1,"55: I was engaged in the game from start to finish, and by the end I was left completely in awe at how good the game was. The gameplay is perfect, the visuals are perfect, the sound design is perfect. Every single minute detail is a testament to the love and effort put into the production of the game, and it was very, very obvious to me.",,,,,,,,55,10.271601,6.558984
peaceful setting,1,"113: The details of the characters, the music, the peaceful setting, the sense of relaxation it brings when playing",,,,,,,,113,10.973896,6.578321
peaceful moment,1,133: The graphics were beautifully detailed and the colors and lighting effect were stunning. It was also a very peaceful moment and I was able to stop in the game and enjoy it.,,,,,,,,133,10.943074,6.5528917
own involvement,1,"0: the richness of pictures/drawings.
- there was almost no text
- it was me who made the art come together",,,,,,,,0,8.195726,9.01723
overall experience with the world organization,1,"93: probably the sad day, mixed to the graphics and the overall experience with the world organisation ",,,,,,,,93,7.489452,9.25323
opinion on subject matter,1,13: art to me means that it brings me on a journey and makes me feel. this game brought me on a journey through its narrative and made me feel for the characters. it had its opinion on the subject matter. ,,,,,,,,13,9.447079,9.591158
opening the door for discussions about games as art,1,"50: I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",,,,,,,,50,10.223994,10.860593
open to interpretation,1,139: The meaning of the story was open to interpretation but felt significant regardless of how you interpreted it. There was a feeling that you were just revealing a story that already existed and experiencing art by uncovering it yourself rather than making something yourself with the game.,,,,,,,,139,8.816527,11.367721
nostalgy,1,"148: The scene had both stunning visuals and audio, and it invoked a sense of nostalgy and longing, just like watching or listening to some other pieces of art might do.",,,,,,,,148,9.388175,8.632013
non-competitive,1,"125: The game is not competitive or exciting, but rather an experience of emotion and storytelling. The game itself is beautiful graphically, but more than that it stays in the mind like a good book, a beautiful painting, or an amazing piece of music. It is this ability for the game to tell a story in an engaging way without resorting to action or puzzle that makes this game art. Not that games with action or puzzle are not art, but the art in the game comes from its serenity and calm while being about something traumatic and painful.",,,,,,,,125,10.908642,6.5629086
nice colors,1,77: It was fantasy scenery.  Nice colours.,,,,,,,,77,9.632294,6.9103355
new perspective,1,"119: The fact that it gave me the same feeling as going to a gallery. A broadening of understanding, and a new perspective on events I have never seen (although art can be something I relate to as well, in this case it wasn't because I've never been in a warzone). ",,,,,,,,119,7.391664,7.8619103
new and unique experience,1,"166: This game felt like art because it questioned the authority of the player, you WERE playing, but then also not really, that was very new
to me at the time, where most games had pretty clear rules and objectives and influences from other media forms were unheard of",,,,,,,,166,7.5127716,7.636822

narrative exploration,1,137: The level of depth and complexity of the deeply ingrained philisophical and ethical questions it both poses to the player and explores within its narrative combine in such a way that calling it anything but art is a disservice to what it is,,,,,,,,137,6.4924955,11.425037
mystery,1,"154: The story was building around you without any real hint at what was actually going on, until you reach the point where you find out what the actual plot and setting is, then realize what your actions actually meant. Coupled with a dramatic visual setting and well fitted music.",,,,,,,,154,8.753221,11.023431
music/sounds,1,"150: The slowness, storyline, drawing style and music/sounds of the game made it feel very artistic. ",,,,,,,,150,11.97777,4.1483703
"music, color palette, and ambiance enhancing gameplay",1,"161: The way that the music, colour palette, and ambiance enhanced the game mechanics. It also featured classical piano pieces that I think added to the artistic feel. I don't think it's enough for a game to simply ""look good"" or ""look real"". I think, like art, there's a craft to providing a sensory experience that moves the viewer to connect with the art.",,,,,,,,161,2.4792132,5.355989
museum-like experience,1,79: It was something about the way it made me feel. The ability for interpretation felt similar to being in a museum.,,,,,,,,79,8.61246,8.369671
multiple meanings,1,"144: The powerful of imply narration and emotional communication without need to state.
And the possibility offer different meanings to the same games elements ",,,,,,,,144,8.692809,11.336447
movie-like experience,1,"40: I consider it art because it reads like a movie and the graphics allow for me to feel immersed as if it was a real life story. It's still a game because it's interactive, but if it was turned into an animated picture, it would still have the same effect and immersion.",,,,,,,,40,8.634043,8.314263
more than pretty pictures,1,"6: Any media that makes the users/viewer think, challenges ones believe is art. Art isn't just pretty pictures but so much more. ",,,,,,,,6,10.634183,7.8650465
moral struggle,1,"111: The culmination of this game really made it art. You play the whole game as Arthur as he tries to make decisions beneficial to his family/friends without hurting others. This moral struggle follows him the whole game and culminates in the ending with the good or evil ending. The good ending has you fighting off a traitorous friend and fighting him off before Arthur dies. The music, the graphics, the location of his death and everything  leading up to it was simply astonishing ",,,,,,,,111,9.203619,11.926225
"mix of architecture, paint, design, digital art, and history telling",1,"35: I can feel it like a mix with architecture, paint, design, digital art and history telling. 
Also, you can win/purchased clothes for your character and each one is more beautiful and detailed than the others.",,,,,,,,35,2.596238,5.4509716
minor storylines,1,"134: The imagery, the music, the voice acting, and the intricate minor storylines.",,,,,,,,134,5.737595,12.483342
meta-commentary on video games,1,80: It was the first that came to mind because there was more to it than just gameplay and story. It was trying to say something about the videogames themselves and how a player think and perceive. ,,,,,,,,80,9.975819,11.0341625
message and interaction,1,"54: I view video games, along with books, paintings, tv series and movies as art.
Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction.",,,,,,,,54,7.1990037,10.199801
message about victory and consequences,1,"26: First of all, it is the uncommon atmosphere I noted above.
The other thing is the message this game tries to send to the players.
That victory isn't always great, and sometimes it is the wrong thing you do, even if it looks good in the beginning.",,,,,,,,26,7.068502,10.247666
meaningful story,1,"41: I consider this experience artistic because like any film or book or painting, it told a story that was deeply meaningful. The narrative of the game and its writing wrestled with issues of morality, class, racism, sexism, and many other topics in ways that many other video games have been afraid to touch. The experience was true to life as it depicted Geralt’s reality in shades of gray rather than being simply black and white, good and evil, etc. One of art’s tendencies is to reflect back to us who we are and what we do in an angle we might not have considered before. I think this game did just that in my experience. ",,,,,,,,41,6.708356,12.016329
meaningful gameplay,1,"171: Well it differed from a lot of other games. Instead of a game about just reaching your goal, this game made you question why you were reaching your goal, everything had a meaning. I’ve played lots of games but that was the first one that made me think about my actions throughout the game ",,,,,,,,171,7.1437635,11.86458

lovely art style,1,"124: The game involves some very interesting themes such as becoming an adult, mental illnesses, accepting change, and questions existence and life and our place in the universe. The art style itself is also very lovely, with cute anthropomorphic animal characters, but I think its simplicity helps a player to focus on the narrative and the themes better, as it did for me.

loss and despair,1,"120: The fact that it was able to invoke such strong emotions from me. It resembles a mother awaiting her children who are off at war, only to be returned a flag for solace. To lose everything you cared for on earth and no longer wishing to be apart of it any longer.",,,,,,,,120,6.3716474,7.338892

literature and film as art,1,"48: I frequently tell people that playing RPGs is similar to reading a book or watching a movie, but you are able to interact and influence the plot. If literature and film are considered art, why wouldn't games be?",,,,,,,,48,10.38123,10.763217

limited gameplay,1,"167: This game is mainly a walking simulator, so there is limited gameplay, but the gameplay that is present is directly related to the current narrative. The gameplay drives the story along and doesn't/can't exist on its own.

I won, but the game made me ask myself if winning was worth it. It made me feel and introspect. That is what made the game art.",,,,,,,,126,0.19971842,9.706882
intriguing symbols,1,"117: The experience was very immersive, it was formed of an intriguing combination of symbols that were left unexplained and it was surprising and perfectly timed.",,,,,,,,117,10.289944,9.480112
interpretive potential,1,42: I consider this experience as art for two reasons. One is that it is extremely innovative and helps to push the boundaries of storytelling in video games and thus matures the entire medium. The other is that it has a deeper and more complex emotional layer that can be interpreted in many ways.,,,,,,,,42,8.791404,11.305562
interpretation,1,79: It was something about the way it made me feel. The ability for interpretation felt similar to being in a museum.,,,,,,,,79,8.723792,11.308435
interactivity,1,"48: I frequently tell people that playing RPGs is similar to reading a book or watching a movie, but you are able to interact and influence the plot. If literature and film are considered art, why wouldn't games be?",,,,,,,,48,7.6317925,10.360507
interactive art,1,"40: I consider it art because it reads like a movie and the graphics allow for me to feel immersed as if it was a real life story. It's still a game because it's interactive, but if it was turned into an animated picture, it would still have the same effect and immersion.",,,,,,,,40,7.391903,10.599187
interactive animated short movie,1,"167: This game is mainly a walking simulator, so there is limited gameplay, but the gameplay that is present is directly related to the current narrative. The gameplay drives the story along and doesn't/can't exist on its own. The game felt like an animated short movie that you would normally just watch, but you get to walk through it at your own pace and drive the narrative yourself.",,,,,,,,167,7.3831325,10.658599
interacting with themes,1,"31: Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle. Media that makes you struggle with these questions I think is the definition of good art.",,,,,,,,31,7.621454,10.275349
interacting with creativity,1,"60: Interacting with creativity (your own, or someone else's, or both), in any way seems to be an artful experience. Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art. Art is often associated with emotional experiences or personal significance. There are probably other things at play that I'm not consciously aware of as well.",,,,,,,,60,7.538093,10.209685
intention of creators,1,"34: I believe video games are art. It doesn't feel right to check off features to qualify for being art. The creators clearly intended it to be so, so it is.",,,,,,,,34,9.966166,9.555211
intended emotional response,1,"17: As mentioned before the fact there was so clearly an intended emotional response, and that was linked to the an attempt to force the player to think about the purpose of games, about themself as a person makes it art.",,,,,,,,17,4.225013,8.188478
integratedness,1,"136: The integratedness of the game - how everything (mechanics, writing, worldbuilding, art) works together to create a world and a narrative, in which very particular themes, experiences and ideas can be dealt with. The interesting tension between the way it captures and expresses an experience, and my awareness of its game-ness. That balance between expressing ideas and experiences, and keeping a distance from those things which I think is a feature of all really interesting art.  ",,,,,,,,136,8.706498,8.841843
inspires thought and emotion,1,7: Any piece of work can be considered art so long as it inspires thought or emotion. Anything that forces it's consumers to confront and reconcile their own inadequacies with their strive to achieve must be art.,,,,,,,,7,3.8774123,9.666542
innovative storytelling,1,42: I consider this experience as art for two reasons. One is that it is extremely innovative and helps to push the boundaries of storytelling in video games and thus matures the entire medium. The other is that it has a deeper and more complex emotional layer that can be interpreted in many ways.,,,,,,,,42,5.7261453,12.064766
individual experience,1,52: i think it's a unique thing to video games as in how the mechanics of gameplay create a story of their that each person experiences distinctly,,,,,,,,52,7.8340774,8.341483
impractical for gameplay,1,142: The people making these builds and sharing them are not doing it for any other purpose than art because they are impractical for fighting mobs or gaining resources or anything else in the game,,,,,,,,142,6.1783137,6.7391105
implied narration,1,"144: The powerful of imply narration and emotional communication without need to state.
And the possibility offer different meanings to the same games elements ",,,,,,,,144,6.415409,11.623541
implications of grinding,1,"169: To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.",,,,,,,,169,4.605253,8.958612
impact on community,1,97: Specifically because it made me evaluate how I live my life and the impact I can have on my community. Art is a reflection of life but at the same time makes us reflect on our lives.,,,,,,,,97,4.091235,8.821736
immersive world,1,66: It is an immersive world and the music was amazing. I honestly feel like the composer should be studied when our current period moves to music history ,,,,,,,,66,8.642741,8.708277
immersion in a fictional world,1,"165: There was something very serene and beautiful about being elevated and getting to see the rest of this particular level of the game. However, more than just seeing the rest of the level, it gave me a sense of being a part of something bigger than myself; here I was, a super skilled ninja set on battling it out with ferocious beasts and expert samurai, and I was just appreciating the view of the sunset. It made my game character feel like an insignificant speck among the rest of the game world, despite me playing the so called ""main character"". What makes a gaming experience feel like art to me is when it is able to take my breathe away and immerse me in a completely fictional world. So to me personally, In that sense, gaming is most like art when it imitates real life - when it makes me feel as though I am simply one small part of something bigger. ",,,,,,,,165,8.182101,9.040486

imaginative and emotional,1,"128: The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.",,,,,,,,128,8.196404,8.07062
imagery,1,"134: The imagery, the music, the voice acting, and the intricate minor storylines.",,,,,,,,134,10.290686,8.720833
horror derived from self-purpose,1,63: It felt like the art style had no intention of catering to anyones pleasure. It seemd like an experiment in which the horror derived from self purpose rather than trying achieve some sort of representation.,,,,,,,,63,0.32190508,9.666603
heart-warming theme,1,"108: The combination of beautiful graphics, a heart-warming theme, and equally captivating music.",,,,,,,,108,8.71594,7.0910177

graphics as art,1,"29: For me instead of the graphics of the game being a means to an end meaning they allowed me to play the game, I experienced the graphics as a means to their own end. I no longer saw the graphics as a way to play the game or as a way to learn something about the game, but as something else entirely. I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way. For me, art is about feeling something and this video game did that using colors and lines instead of just dialogue and story. ",,,,,,,,29,10.753425,9.427369
graphics and animations as art,1,37: I consider almost all games as art. They possess stories which are often works of art. Graphics and animations which are absolutely works of art. ,,,,,,,,37,10.777153,9.447925
graphical style,1,"65: It is a basic murder mystery/logic puzzle. Thanks to the graphical style, the way the player discovers the information and the story, the game is a work of art.",,,,,,,,65,10.6668005,9.240911
graphic design,1,"4: All the parts of the game when considered as a whole. When you take in consideration the music, the graphic design, the writing, and of course the gameplay. Its in games like this when you are aware of be playing an artwork, rather than just another game. ",,,,,,,,4,10.988728,9.732504

geographic features,1,"101: The amazing attention to detail in the visual space, from architecture/infrastructure, wildlife and plants, geographic/environmental features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, forests and prairies. ",,,,,,,,101,9.799889,9.544698
gameplay in service of story,1,"85: Like a film or book, it was clearly intended to elicit an emotional response and tell a story. Unlike some other games, the story was not there to connect the gameplay: rather, the gameplay was there to advance the story.",,,,,,,,85,8.191704,10.724478
gameplay in service of narrative,1,"167: This game is mainly a walking simulator, so there is limited gameplay, but the gameplay that is present is directly related to the current narrative. The gameplay drives the story along and doesn't/can't exist on its own.

full engagement with the game world,1,"94: really all video games are art, but from me to truly enjoy the art I need to be fully engaged in its world ",,,,,,,,94,8.147743,9.828946
freedom of exploration,1,87: Mostly that it just is. It doesn't ask you to do anything - you get to explore and experience it however you choose.,,,,,,,,87,6.4961805,11.209627
fits traditional definition of art,1,"50: I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",,,,,,,,50,9.809663,9.894007
felt like participating in an interactive graphic novel,1,"89: Mostly what I described above. Elaborating a little, the game play was not as much of a focus, despite it being a game. It felt more like you were participating in an interactive graphic novel/art project. The emphasis was on the emotions it evoked and connections you felt with the characters -- or rather how you can put yourself very easily in their shoes based on your own experiences with love",,,,,,,,89,7.762922,7.9671016
feeling something through visuals,1,"29: For me instead of the graphics of the game being a means to an end meaning they allowed me to play the game, I experienced the graphics as a means to their own end. I no longer saw the graphics as a way to play the game or as a way to learn something about the game, but as something else entirely. I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way.

feeling of accomplishment,1,"110: The connections made , the emotional attachments cultivated, and mostly the balance struck between button mashing and true real feel action. When your choices carry over from series to series, and in the finale' your in a better position because you had wisdom and thought ahead it's a glorious feeling. ",,,,,,,,110,6.4067597,8.36404
feeling connected to the player character,1,"143: The poignant, evocative writing and depth of emotion, and the fact that even though I wasn't making choices that affected the narrative in any way, moving through the environment helped me feel connected to the player character's life.",,,,,,,,143,5.9530244,8.900689
fantasy scenery,1,77: It was fantasy scenery.  Nice colours.,,,,,,,,77,11.533344,7.186638
familiarity,1,"46: I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything I’ve seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar. I liked that even through the chaos and destruction brought about by players and NPCs, the sunshine never went away, and the whole world had this constant “gloss” that made it perfect. ",,,,,,,,46,8.465233,9.066753
exploration of the human condition,1,"64: It had a profound emotional impact on me which I can still feel to this day, and it made me consider aspects of the human condition which I previously hadn’t. I found the impact to be greater than many books I’ve read and films I’ve watched, because of the unique aspect of actually controlling the character in his journey.",,,,,,,,64,6.3790665,11.163713
exploration,1,158: The way it looks and how you get to experience it and explore the different terrain makes me feel like I’m in a huge art gallery. Everything is meant to be looked at and explored with the intent that it is living art.,,,,,,,,158,6.411456,11.089404
experimental art,1,63: It felt like the art style had no intention of catering to anyones pleasure. It seemd like an experiment in which the horror derived from self purpose rather than trying achieve some sort of representation.,,,,,,,,63,7.264326,10.673262

exceptionally good storytelling,1,"140: The mix between exceptionally good story telling and philosophy and the beautiful, yet apocalyptic, surroundings.",,,,,,,,140,5.39284,12.094234

evoking feelings,1,"62: It evoked some sort of feeling in me. To be art, it has to be able to make people feel things at the bare minimum.",,,,,,,,62,5.6750774,8.464788
evocativeness,1,"83: Its sheer evocativeness, and nothing else.",,,,,,,,83,8.047341,8.342561
environment design,1,"147: The scenario because of the colours it used, the design of the environment, the music it involved and the different events that made it more exciting. ",,,,,,,,147,11.205487,9.935618
enjoyment of good drawings,1,"49: I guess simply because the entire game looks like a drawing, and as an artist I really enjoyed that. People seem to want art to always be something deeper, but I just enjoy good drawings.",,,,,,,,49,9.86345,8.106058
engaging gameplay,1,"55: I was engaged in the game from start to finish, and by the end I was left completely in awe at how good the game was. The gameplay is perfect, the visuals are perfect, the sound design is perfect. Every single minute detail is a testament to the love and effort put into the production of the game, and it was very, very obvious to me.",,,,,,,,55,8.43768,10.170029

engagement,1,"61: It brought something different to a game, it made me feel strong emotions, it engaged me fully and still has me daydreaming about it weeks later. A lot of detail was put into engaging players.",,,,,,,,61,8.127144,10.101519
encodes humanity,1,"12: Art should make us think and reflect. Art should be able to be analyzed critically and should tell us something about ourselves or the person(s) who create the art--things cultural, personal, historical, etc. Art is an artifact that encodes the spectrum of our humanity and asks us to face this truth.",,,,,,,,12,10.168804,10.641704
emptiness,1,"27: First thing, the beauty of the view. Such a scene would be beautiful in real life, but seeing it in a game, knowing all the work that was required to show this is mind-blowing. But the valley also brings a lot of feelings, both excitement (to explore this new world) and emptiness, looking at how small you are and peaceful everything looks. Finally, it is one of the first times you see something this big in the game, showing how you progressed in the game, adding to the said feelings. ",,,,,,,,27,6.315739,7.192602
empathy with the main character,1,"1: ""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.",,,,,,,,1,6.0539107,9.567684
empathy with other players,1,"116: The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming. Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped. I had never seen a truly altruistic action performed by another player in a video game - up until this point.",,,,,,,,116,6.120228,9.633227
emotionally provocative,1,"91: Per definition, art is something that is man-made and supposed to primarily provoke thought or emotion. I generally consider video games art, but this moment was especially emotionally provocative.",,,,,,,,91,3.9909396,9.411988
emotional story without dialogue,1,105: The beautiful and calm design and the use of a very emotional story without the protagonists speaking. ,,,,,,,,105,4.943416,8.947084
emotional implications,1,"82: It's one of those game that are loaded with emotional implications, make a clever and conscious use of game mechanics, and where every aspect of the game supports every other aspect of the game and the overall play experience. I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.",,,,,,,,82,4.4578824,8.883174
emotional experiences,1,"60: Interacting with creativity (your own, or someone else's, or both), in any way seems to be an artful experience. Stories and storytelling is commonly held as an art.

emotional attachment,1,"173: Whenever I remember this game I am flooded with memories and feelings I have attached to it. This game created an experience for me that I will treasure. This game also has a unique and beautiful art style. I get the same feelings when I remember this game as I do when I remember a painting or movie I saw, if anything to a greater extent.",,,,,,,,173,5.78406,9.337123
emotional and intellectual response,1,"115: The emotional, and intellectual response it elicited in me. ",,,,,,,,115,4.22012,8.265125
effort invested in making the game,1,"2: A group of people took time and effort in making this area of the game, Kaer Morhen (and honestly most of the game too, the experience was simply more profound here), so beautiful. It was akin to looking at a photographer's work and wanting to physically visit where the picture was taken.",,,,,,,,2,12.550696,7.8875356

drawing style,1,"150: The slowness, storyline, drawing style and music/sounds of the game made it feel very artistic. ",,,,,,,,150,9.890555,8.95486
dramatic visuals,1,"154: The story was building around you without any real hint at what was actually going on, until you reach the point where you find out what the actual plot and setting is, then realize what your actions actually meant. Coupled with a dramatic visual setting and well fitted music.",,,,,,,,154,10.260763,8.149227
doing instead of telling,1,"31: Having the player interact directly with the themes of the game and having those present in the gameplay is a great way to make a player experience the intended art. The saying in storytelling is that one should show and not tell but games can take it a step further by having you do instead of telling. There are dozens of games that accomplish this really well but like with movies, not all games are trying to be art. Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

In my mind, the core is that a videogame is art of it makes you feel something just by playing it. That feeling is often just joy but often times games can make you feel so much more than that. Nier: Automata makes you question ""What is human?"", Detroit: Beyond Human makes you ask ""Is this ethical?"", God of War (2018) makes you tackle parenthood, Shadow of the Colossus makes you question ""Is this justified?"", Death Stranding asks if the journey is worth the struggle. Media that makes you struggle with these questions I think is the definition of good art.",,,,,,,,31,7.7288294,9.583384
diverse emotional experiences,1,121: The feelings I felt while playing and the complete different feelings others felt while playing. ,,,,,,,,121,4.9365344,8.515915
distinct,1,"15: As before: it was engaging, thought-provoking, very distinct and often unenjoyable - a work of art that I appreciate aesthetically yet also find numerous flaws with",,,,,,,,15,8.041951,7.6086593
disregard for profitability,1,"104: The author created an interactive story that tells of characters and their stories. Meant to invoce strong emotions and attachment to these characters  with no regard to profitability, marketability, or mass appeal of the game as a product. ",,,,,,,,104,8.526573,10.222365
discovery of information,1,"65: It is a basic murder mystery/logic puzzle. Thanks to the graphical style, the way the player discovers the information and the story, the game is a work of art.",,,,,,,,65,6.308645,10.912098
discovering the path,1,"54: I view video games, along with books, paintings, tv series and movies as art.
Video games have the double edged sword of being comprised of not only a message that the author (developers) want to transmit to you as a gamer, but also the means of interaction. 
Interaction lets you see the artistic values of a game from different perspectives and more often than not shape them to fit your own values.
Baldur's Gate, a classic RPG, is no exception. The storyline is for you to follow, but the path is yours to discover. Immersive is a key word for art mediums, the ability to feel and touch another world and learn about it and its inhabitants by means of interaction.",,,,,,,,54,6.3157616,10.839981
direct communication,1,"20: Because it transcended the game itself. Normally a game is the medium that you interpret a story or something through, but this felt like it was directly to me without any translation.",,,,,,,,20,7.207745,9.957
different type of experience,1,86: Likely because it was presented to me in the context of an example of a video game as art. But I accepted this because it was a very different type of experience delivered in such a simple and effective package. ,,,,,,,,86,7.706839,7.6133165
dialogue with the developer,1,"50: I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationship—he does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art. It fits the Anglophone–patriarchal–normative/prescriptive idea of what art is. While I do not think we should pander to that definition of art (all canons are bullshit, but especially male-dominated Western ones), artsy games like The Beginner's Guide get a 'foot in the door' and make it possible to point to more heterogeneous, less pretentious or chin-strokey games, and start having discussions with non-gamers about how those are also equally art.",,,,,,,,50,7.610996,10.21125
details of characters,1,"113: The details of the characters, the music, the peaceful setting, the sense of relaxation it brings when playing",,,,,,,,113,9.607945,5.9989915
detailed environment,1,88: Mostly the storyline and the detail put into the environment ,,,,,,,,88,9.633733,6.025698
design,1,"102: the artstyle, the music, the thought process that must have gone into the design, the meaning of it, showing the meaning through audiovisuals AND gameplay. The ludnonarrative harmony.",,,,,,,,102,11.130481,9.946485
depth and complexity,1,137: The level of depth and complexity of the deeply ingrained philisophical and ethical questions it both poses to the player and explores within its narrative combine in such a way that calling it anything but art is a disservice to what it is,,,,,,,,137,3.6045284,7.92225
deliberate choices of developers,1,21: being aware that the game was the way it was because of deliberate choices the developers made,,,,,,,,21,9.074572,10.299853
deeply felt emotions,1,"39: I consider it art as it made me truly and deeply feel something. I can watch a movie stupid. Where I sit there and don’t take any of it in, maybe I laugh at the jokes but at the end I’m not truly moved in anyway. Whereas playing Portal 2 made me truly happy with its comedy and I felt good about myself upon completing puzzles. It’s left a lasting impression that I’ll never forget.",,,,,,,,39,3.8266957,8.119816
deeper motivation,1,164: There is a deeper motiv to the game or the story than just getting it over with. There are feelings and lessons in it,,,,,,,,164,3.6006293,7.9301057
deep thoughts and emotions,1,"1: ""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws. That, to me, is what makes art: an experience that draws you in and allows you to understand things you would otherwise write off.",,,,,,,,1,3.6442816,8.214412
deep emotional response,1,"76: It was art because it brought about a deeply emotional response in me, one which was impacted by the perspective of the player. Art, to me, is a purely emotional experience that changes with the perspective of the one experiencing it. Oxenfree fit this description when I played it. ",,,,,,,,76,4.080756,8.316146
"cultural, personal, historical aspects",1,"12: Art should make us think and reflect. Art should be able to be analyzed critically and should tell us something about ourselves or the person(s) who create the art--things cultural, personal, historical, etc. Art is an artifact that encodes the spectrum of our humanity and asks us to face this truth.",,,,,,,,12,9.735624,10.378848
culmination,1,"111: The culmination of this game really made it art. You play the whole game as Arthur as he tries to make decisions beneficial to his family/friends without hurting others. This moral struggle follows him the whole game and culminates in the ending with the good or evil ending. The good ending has you fighting off a traitorous friend and fighting him off before Arthur dies. The music, the graphics, the location of his death and everything  leading up to it was simply astonishing ",,,,,,,,111,9.153345,8.683836
critique of gamer culture,1,"50: I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture.

creative,1,"23: creative, beautiful",,,,,,,,23,8.348893,8.409081
creation of graphics,1,"24: Defining what art is is super subjective, but to me this counted because 1. people had to create those graphics, and 2 . I liked it and thought it was pretty (which yes, is not necessary for art,)",,,,,,,,24,10.928584,9.3431425
creating a world,1,"33: I believe storytelling and creating a world are a form of art. Playing the game feels like taking part in an interactive story. I compare it to reading, but the story is conveyed differently and lets me choose.",,,,,,,,33,11.164153,9.488482
created for artistic purposes,1,142: The people making these builds and sharing them are not doing it for any other purpose than art because they are impractical for fighting mobs or gaining resources or anything else in the game,,,,,,,,142,10.048936,9.526506
conveying something beyond the game world,1,"82: It's one of those game that are loaded with emotional implications, make a clever and conscious use of game mechanics, and where every aspect of the game supports every other aspect of the game and the overall play experience. I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.",,,,,,,,82,5.523262,8.822943
conveying complex messages and emotions,1,"68: It made me experience feelings that I had rarely if ever encountered on other media. Playing as the characters makes you able to emphatise with them and through their actions the artists are able to convey complex messages and emotions. When well executed, I think the player is not merely a spectator, but a ""cable"" that feels the energy passing through",,,,,,,,68,5.290273,8.830639
context of playing,1,86: Likely because it was presented to me in the context of an example of a video game as art. But I accepted this because it was a very different type of experience delivered in such a simple and effective package. ,,,,,,,,86,8.970109,9.667039
constant sunshine,1,"46: I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything I’ve seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar. I liked that even through the chaos and destruction brought about by players and NPCs, the sunshine never went away, and the whole world had this constant “gloss” that made it perfect. ",,,,,,,,46,10.541782,6.5480633
connection with the game through visuals,1,"29: For me instead of the graphics of the game being a means to an end meaning they allowed me to play the game, I experienced the graphics as a means to their own end. I no longer saw the graphics as a way to play the game or as a way to learn something about the game, but as something else entirely. I stopped playing and simply looked at the graphics as I would paintings on the wall of a museum and for a moment I felt connected to the game in a completely different way. For me, art is about feeling something and this video game did that using colors and lines instead of just dialogue and story. ",,,,,,,,29,6.291084,9.063943
connection with protagonist,1,"98: Story telling, visuals, voice acting and the fact that I felt connected to the protagonist.",,,,,,,,98,6.132508,9.133289
connecting with the art,1,"161: The way that the music, colour palette, and ambiance enhanced the game mechanics. It also featured classical piano pieces that I think added to the artistic feel. I don't think it's enough for a game to simply ""look good"" or ""look real"". I think, like art, there's a craft to providing a sensory experience that moves the viewer to connect with the art.",,,,,,,,161,6.40465,9.345713
confronting and reconciling inadequacies,1,7: Any piece of work can be considered art so long as it inspires thought or emotion. Anything that forces it's consumers to confront and reconcile their own inadequacies with their strive to achieve must be art.,,,,,,,,7,9.412296,12.2545395
conflict,1,"59: In order to advance in the game, the player has to exploit the planet's resources and mark its surface. It encapsulates the conflict inherent in advancing standards of living by exploiting nature. The player doesn't even know where the outputs are going, just that their employer, Ficsit Corporation, requires them.",,,,,,,,59,9.12571,11.719648
complex emotional response,1,67: It left a lasting impression on me. I think it was quite a meaningful end to the game and it elicited a complex emotional response.,,,,,,,,67,4.007359,8.135105
complex emotional layer,1,42: I consider this experience as art for two reasons. One is that it is extremely innovative and helps to push the boundaries of storytelling in video games and thus matures the entire medium. The other is that it has a deeper and more complex emotional layer that can be interpreted in many ways.,,,,,,,,42,3.8128583,8.027686
competition between pressures,1,"109: The competition between different pressures (described above), and possibly the drab color pallette and pixelation, made me feel a sense of despair that would not be possible outside of art, absent real personal tragedy.",,,,,,,,109,9.468992,9.73496
compelling writing,1,"53: I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic. I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings. I also found the writing and stories compelling and it was easy for me to be emotionally invested in it, in the way I would be invested in a well-written book.",,,,,,,,53,4.9780354,12.02125
compelling storyline,1,"92: Playing AC Origins felt like art for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was visually captivating. Between the landscapes, ruins, temples and other architecture, etc- the environment is like an exploreable piece of visual art. The writing was also very good, I felt. Playing a well-written game can feel like being immersed in a very long interactive film. And I most definitely view film as art. AC Origins had a compelling and engaging main character and storyline. In fact, I cried a number of times during my playthrough of the game while watching some of the more impactful cut scenes. Much like films are large collaborative pieces of art, I definitely believe video games are as well. ",,,,,,,,92,5.2189174,12.144838
compelling story,1,"131: The graphics of the game, the story line, and the character development were done so well that I consider it art. The graphics are seemingly flawless, with the sun light angles being presented realistically, the colors are vibrant and varied, the story is compelling, the scenery itself tells a story (with the machine coming our of the mountain)...
",,,,,,,,131,5.4182887,12.182506
comparable to other forms of art,1,"36: I can't entirely say, since I don't have a particularly concrete definition (it strikes me as one of those frustratingly vague things like gender, and not something that can clearly be defined in a sentence or two), but it evoked at least as much emotional impact in me as other media experiences (books, movies, etc.) that I know typically are considered art, so it seems to fit to me.",,,,,,,,36,9.9486065,9.992039
commentary on culture,1,"46: I felt like the game scenery was more beautiful than anything I’ve seen in real life, even though it also had a realism to it. It seemed to comment on my country and its culture through visuals, and sound effects. I drove around or walked around the map a lot just to feel like I was someplace familiar. I liked that even through the chaos and destruction brought about by players and NPCs, the sunshine never went away, and the whole world had this constant “gloss” that made it perfect. ",,,,,,,,46,9.9213705,11.08247
"combination of writing, music, and visuals",1,"128: The game was aesthetically very pleasing, for one. All of the creative parts of the game felt imaginative and evoked emotion. It also left me thinking about big questions. The game is very beautifully crafted to be an immersive experience that you can get lost in and live out this life in the shoes of an empty void creatures who was sacrificed to save a whole kingdom that still eventually started falling. I think the part that made me feel like the game was art the most was the world building. It combines great writing, great music and great visuals.",,,,,,,,128,2.7590578,5.4405103
"combination of visuals, sound, music, and storytelling",1,"28: For a game experience to feel like a work of art to me, it would usually be an immersive experience that creates a real emotional response. Since games accomplish this through a combination of illustration, animation, sound, music, storytelling elements all together, I would consider these types of experiences art.",,,,,,,,28,2.6548197,5.4204187
"combination of visuals, music, and story",1,"57: If we take art to be something created in order to impart emotional experiences on others (my favourite vague definition), then Life is Strange has so so many of those. The basic-looking but gorgeous visuals full of rustic charm and colour, the indie music playing away in the background just over the ambience of life going on as normal, the story perfectly blending in with these elements and ticking away in your mind as you play. It was the first and only time I'd believed in the word immersion as something games were capable of achieving.  The state of bliss and relaxation at the world, but also emotional investment in the characters and even the town itself was unparalleled to me. ",,,,,,,,57,2.7291684,5.360837
combination of visual art and music,1,"45: I feel most games are a form of art, but this one in particular really combined visual art and music in a way that is undeniably artistic.",,,,,,,,45,2.8485596,5.515161
"combination of gameplay, music, and world design",1,"129: The gameplay, the music, the world design, all of it. Video games are an art form of itself.",,,,,,,,129,2.5226793,5.3496985
combination of elements,1,3: All the elements being combined to give me this unique experience.,,,,,,,,3,3.0346358,5.6031194
"combination of art style, music, and narrative",1,"22: Combination of art style, music and where this comes in the game narrative.",,,,,,,,22,2.5856023,5.4024367
combination of all forms of art,1,"163: The writing already is a work of art, it's crafted in such a thoughtful and intelligent way that makes you feel immersed in the moment. The set design is phenomenal as all the spectacle that you see is literally and figuratively out of this world. You can feel the wonder and fear of every turn, the crew feel alive and believable. The sound design and choice of sounds are perfect. This game is exactly the combination of all forms of art into one experience.",,,,,,,,163,2.964188,5.553328

beautifully detailed graphics,1,133: The graphics were beautifully detailed and the colors and lighting effect were stunning. It was also a very peaceful moment and I was able to stop in the game and enjoy it.,,,,,,,,133,9.921286,6.353694
beautiful surroundings,1,"140: The mix between exceptionally good story telling and philosophy and the beautiful, yet apocalyptic, surroundings.",,,,,,,,140,11.3755,7.117573
beautiful graphics,1,"108: The combination of beautiful graphics, a heart-warming theme, and equally captivating music.",,,,,,,,108,10.227606,6.651434
beautiful and detailed clothes,1,"35: I can feel it like a mix with architecture, paint, design, digital art and history telling. 
Also, you can win/purchased clothes for your character and each one is more beautiful and detailed than the others.",,,,,,,,35,9.923484,6.444535
beautiful and calm design,1,105: The beautiful and calm design and the use of a very emotional story without the protagonists speaking. ,,,,,,,,105,10.828062,6.7597194
beautiful,1,"23: creative, beautiful",,,,,,,,23,10.655383,7.08521
balance between expression and distance,1,"136: The integratedness of the game - how everything (mechanics, writing, worldbuilding, art) works together to create a world and a narrative, in which very particular themes, experiences and ideas can be dealt with. The interesting tension between the way it captures and expresses an experience, and my awareness of its game-ness. That balance between expressing ideas and experiences, and keeping a distance from those things which I think is a feature of all really interesting art.  ",,,,,,,,136,9.116941,9.988576
balance between action and choice,1,"110: The connections made , the emotional attachments cultivated, and mostly the balance struck between button mashing and true real feel action. When your choices carry over from series to series, and in the finale' your in a better position because you had wisdom and thought ahead it's a glorious feeling. ",,,,,,,,110,9.053098,10.1359625
awe,1,"27: First thing, the beauty of the view. Such a scene would be beautiful in real life, but seeing it in a game, knowing all the work that was required to show this is mind-blowing. But the valley also brings a lot of feelings, both excitement (to explore this new world) and emptiness, looking at how small you are and peaceful everything looks. Finally, it is one of the first times you see something this big in the game, showing how you progressed in the game, adding to the said feelings. ",,,,,,,,27,12.076124,7.787346
awareness of playing an artwork,1,"4: All the parts of the game when considered as a whole. When you take in consideration the music, the graphic design, the writing, and of course the gameplay. Its in games like this when you are aware of be playing an artwork, rather than just another game. ",,,,,,,,4,9.308532,9.685974
audiovisuals,1,"102: the artstyle, the music, the thought process that must have gone into the design, the meaning of it, showing the meaning through audiovisuals AND gameplay. The ludnonarrative harmony.",,,,,,,,102,10.40289,8.242193
audio,1,"148: The scene had both stunning visuals and audio, and it invoked a sense of nostalgy and longing, just like watching or listening to some other pieces of art might do.",,,,,,,,148,11.784313,4.446468
attention to detail in visuals,1,"101: The amazing attention to detail in the visual space, from architecture/infrastructure, wildlife and plants, geographic/environmental features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, forests and prairies. ",,,,,,,,101,9.664897,6.033049
attachment to characters,1,"104: The author created an interactive story that tells of characters and their stories. Meant to invoce strong emotions and attachment to these characters  with no regard to profitability, marketability, or mass appeal of the game as a product. ",,,,,,,,104,5.880239,9.380402
atmosphere,1,"51: I think it was the perfect combination of the atmosphere, colors, story and most importantly the soundtrack, I still listen to some of the songs of that soundtrack",,,,,,,,51,8.93543,7.7087975
artstyle,1,"102: the artstyle, the music, the thought process that must have gone into the design, the meaning of it, showing the meaning through audiovisuals AND gameplay. The ludnonarrative harmony.",,,,,,,,102,9.514427,9.272481
artistic graphics,1,"107: The choices I made affected the outcome, and there were themes to the story that stuck with me once I was done playing. The graphics were also artistically done and beautiful.",,,,,,,,107,10.568863,9.339343
artistic expression,1,"82: It's one of those game that are loaded with emotional implications, make a clever and conscious use of game mechanics, and where every aspect of the game supports every other aspect of the game and the overall play experience. I would differentiate it from something like Candy Crush in that Candy Crush doesn't strike me as a game that is trying to convey expression. This War of Mine goes beyond entertainment through its gameplay, narrative, music, art. I think an artistic game tries to use its medium to convey something that goes beyond the gameworld - in the same way that a book or a movie are not self-contained and are usually a means for the artist to express something else.",,,,,,,,82,9.576186,9.668139
artistic direction,1,152: The story mirrored the artistic direction of a film,,,,,,,,152,10.084377,9.752636
art as explanation,1,123: The feelings it gave me. I've never felt that way from movies or games or music. Art is the only explanation.,,,,,,,,123,9.969077,10.595148
art as emotion-driven experience,1,"44: I didn't care about the gameplay or mechanics; I was motivated entirely by the visual and emotional beauty, and the emotional experience was so powerful that I still feel strongly when I reflect on the experience. To me, that emotion & beauty driven experience makes it art.",,,,,,,,44,4.9265604,8.594183
architecture,1,"101: The amazing attention to detail in the visual space, from architecture/infrastructure, wildlife and plants, geographic/environmental features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, forests and prairies. ",,,,,,,,101,11.244893,9.91115
appreciation for the creators,1,"56: I was young, so at the time, this title stood apart. The sun has a face and it wants to hurt you. A raccoon tail let you fly! It was thinking that someone (at the time I probably didn't know that a team of people made this) had to make this, be this creative. ",,,,,,,,56,12.368028,7.988895
appreciation despite flaws,1,"15: As before: it was engaging, thought-provoking, very distinct and often unenjoyable - a work of art that I appreciate aesthetically yet also find numerous flaws with",,,,,,,,15,12.386067,7.9297786
appreciation,1,"100: The ability to easily become totally immersed and lost within the game, and lose my thoughts and just appreciate whatever it is that I am immersed in. That is art.",,,,,,,,100,12.334336,7.8901677
apocalyptic atmosphere,1,"140: The mix between exceptionally good story telling and philosophy and the beautiful, yet apocalyptic, surroundings.",,,,,,,,140,9.010772,7.6880717
analogous to other forms of art,1,"85: Like a film or book, it was clearly intended to elicit an emotional response and tell a story. Unlike some other games, the story was not there to connect the gameplay: rather, the gameplay was there to advance the story.",,,,,,,,85,10.076634,10.241668
amazing music,1,66: It is an immersive world and the music was amazing. I honestly feel like the composer should be studied when our current period moves to music history ,,,,,,,,66,12.042614,4.0647297
altruistic action by other players,1,"116: The experience really makes you feel empathy towards the other players going trough the same fight that you are - a feeling that is often lacking in the highly competitive nature of gaming. Also, during this section, the song that is playing (Weight of the world, End of Yorha version) fits the theme of never losing hope perfectly and urges you to fight on. Also, the songs last part - humming of the chorus - is actually performed by the games developers - whose very names you just shot out of the dark sky. 
When you receive help from another player, it's not just someone deciding to randomly help you for a trophy or for fun. That person had to DELETE their save file in order to send you - and only you - that help. And they got absolutely nothing in return, no trophy, no unlock, no extra cutscene (well, they get a different background in the main menu but that is hardly worth deleting your file for). They deleted all their hard work, all the time and effort they put into the game, just to help you - a total stranger. And they will never even know who or even that they helped. I had never seen a truly altruistic action performed by another player in a video game - up until this point.",,,,,,,,116,6.413968,9.781826
agency of interpretation,1,"145: The quality of the worst that was put in as well as the over all experience of playing the game. The message also helped. It wasnt just a save the world type situation or a shoot and kill type game, even though technically it is a linear railroaded type game, it still gave you some agency of interpretation which I think is present in all art.",,,,,,,,145,8.868846,11.260512
aesthetically pleasing,1,"53: I think it's because the style of the game struck me as more artistic than a game where the design is extremely realistic. I could see the effort designers put into making it aesthetically pleasing, but the style still felt unique in the way that a specific artist's style is unique and different from other paintings. I also found the writing and stories compelling and it was easy for me to be emotionally invested in it, in the way I would be invested in a well-written book.",,,,,,,,53,10.665894,7.134074
aesthetic experience,1,"18: As stated above, the aesthetic experience of the game - The 'ingredients' of visuals, musical, philosophy, and story-telling combined. ",,,,,,,,18,9.366497,8.587211
admiration,1,"172: When it made me feel something I would not expect to feel from this type of game, when it gave me pause to admire it.",,,,,,,,172,12.254431,7.8491163
abstract communication of emotion,1,"58: In my opinion, art is a form of communicating emotion in abstract ways, whether through a painting or a piece of music. This game was an incredibly emotional journey that I felt very connected to despite never being told what to feel. ",,,,,,,,58,5.1789203,8.823018
