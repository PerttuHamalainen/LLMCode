There was a massive lake in the middle. <b>Everything seemed so peaceful and serene it was like being inside a painting. I felt truly awed, not only at the scenery but at the work the developers put in to make it look so beautiful.</b><hr>While playing The Legend of Zelda: BOTW it was clear that I was experiencing. Elements such as music, art style, ambient sound, level design, and <b>the free roaming nature of the game helped me feel guided but also free to do as I pleased.</b><hr>When you take in consideration the music, the graphic design, the writing, and of course the gameplay. Its in games like this when you are aware of be playing an artwork, rather than just another game. <hr>In this game because of the attention to detail it felt extremely real. The graphics were incredible and it really immerses you in the game. <b>There are several instances where you can sit and see the scenery which is honestly just breath taking</b>. <b>It felt like watching a movie but getting to experience it first hand. </b><hr>There is this game that really challenges a player to think about and question what we know of the world. The game basically loops over and over and as you complete these loops the world starts breaking down. The things you knew, the rules you lived by all go out the window, <b>leaving you questioning what the meaning of life really is. </b><hr><b>Just last night I was playing an online shooter and got absolutely pissed at my own poor performance</b>.<hr><b>When I played this game, I was immediately awestruck by it&#x27;s simplistic beauty--both visually and audibly</b>. <b>The storyline could also be considered a work of art, albeit somewhat abstract. It made me feel contemplative, happy, sad, and nostalgic. </b>Because it is a puzzle-based game, it made me think about the solution. <b>Sometimes it was sort of frustrating</b>, but I also played it while I was laying in bed, about to sleep. Otherwise, everything about this game could be considered art, from the visuals and music to the story and puzzles.<hr><b>Aside from the countless vistas the game provides, there is a moment at the very ended that affected me so profoundly that it couldn&#x27;t think of any better way to explain it as art</b>. You have spent the entire game nurturing this relationship with Delilah, as well as trying to handle Henry&#x27;s own trauma. So much of their conversations reflecated how I felt, handled things. I wanted there to be a happy ending, a way in which both characters step away contented. But in truth, <b>the ending is almost hallow, a real gut punch</b>. I remember sitting as the credits role, <b>wishing I could go back or somehow change the events</b>, but they needed to be as they were to be that impactful. <hr>"

        "1. Training data: This is used to train a model. When using readymade LLM's, one does not have access to the training data, and we can ignore this concept here.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Validation data: This is typically used to search for the best possible [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning) such as when to stop training or how many layers to use in a neural network model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Test data: This is used to test the performance of the final model after the hyperparameter tuning. *Separating test and validation data avoids overly optimistic test results caused by overfitting the hyperparameters to the validation data*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The prompt instructions and examples can be considered as hyperparameters. Therefore, **one should ideally iterate/optimize the prompt with validation data and when done, verify the performance with separate test data**. This is especially important if your human-defined reference dataset is small.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For academic research, we recommend using at least 100 texts for both the validation and test data**, i.e., the data file should have at least 200 texts with human-annotated ground truth highlights, as the first 100 would be used for validation and next 100 for testing.\n",

(though I love so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested in a modern day story based of legends myths and conspiracies being real). In this quest, an incredibly smart 8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last survivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through Carl Jung&#x27;s theory of the shared subconscious. To do this, you fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You start by picking out of three words, which best describes you. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the opposite. It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like &quot;Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?&quot; &quot;Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?&quot; All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think you&#x27;ve won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up. Personally, I believe its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure. Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung&#x27;s philosophy, I hope to be someday soon. But this was about fifteen minutes of a game with a hundred hours, at least, of content. In my mind, art is anything where a medium is used to convey emotions and provoke thought. Through the whole path, I was locked in a reflective state on what made me &quot;me&quot;, and what doesn&#x27;t. When I saw the parent buff and read &quot;they will be there for you in your time of need&quot;, I remembered how much I loved my parents, how much they tried for me and still do despite it all. When I walked through the door to say I was a loner, I really did pause and think on how, despite past anguish, Id chosen that reality myself. I can&#x27;t change that, but there are upsides to the choice. With part of my definition of art being a medium that conveys emotion and provokes thought, this hits the nail. Thanks for letting me talk about this game, its <b>moved me beyond belief</b>. And Ive only talked about ten or so minutes of it. This was technically a side quest.</td>\n",

It then leads you through a series of doors, with questions like &quot;Did you leave your parents, or did they leave you?&quot; &quot;Did you have friends? Was that your choice, or were you shunned?&quot; All of these choices lead to a boss at the end of the path, you. The answers you gave result in different buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being alone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think you&#x27;ve won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to the start of the path. The only way out is to evade your shadow and wake yourself up. <b>Personally, I believe its conveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat the darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you are and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the inside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed to maintain your day to day composure.</b> Maybe Id think somewhat differently if I was more well read on Carl Jung&#x27;s philosophy, I hope to be someday soon. But this was about fifteen minutes of a game with a hundred hours, at least, of content. <b>In my mind, art is anything where a medium is used to convey emotions and provoke thought. Through the whole path, I was locked in a reflective state on what made me &quot;me&quot;, and what doesn&#x27;t.</b> <b>When I saw the parent buff and read &quot;they will be there for you in your time of need&quot;, I remembered how much I loved my parents, how much they tried for me and still do despite it all.</b> <b>When I walked through the door to say I was a loner, I really did pause and think on how, despite past anguish, Id chosen that reality myself. I can&#x27;t change that, but there are upsides to the choice.</b> <b>With part of my definition of art being a medium that conveys emotion and provokes thought, this hits the nail.</b> <b>Thanks for letting me talk about this game, its moved me beyond belief.</b> And Ive only talked about ten or so minutes of it. This was technically a side quest.</td>\n",
